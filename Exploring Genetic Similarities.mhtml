W. F. Edwards.[1] He criticises an argument first made in Richard Lewontin's 1972 article "The Apportionment of Human Diversity", that the practice of dividing humanity into races is taxonomically invalid because any given individual will often have more in common genetically with members of other population groups than with members of their own.[2] Edwards argued that this does not refute the biological reality of race since genetic analysis can usually make correct inferences about the perceived race of a person from whom a sample is taken, and that the rate of success increases when more genetic loci are examined.[1]

Edwards' paper was reprinted, commented upon by experts such as Noah Rosenberg,[3] and given further context in an interview with philosopher of science Rasmus Grønfeldt Winther in a 2018 anthology.[4] Edwards' critique is discussed in a number of academic and popular science books, with varying degrees of support.[5][6][7]

Some scholars, including Winther and Jonathan Marks, dispute the premise of "Lewontin's fallacy", arguing that Edwards' critique does not actually contradict Lewontin's argument.[7][8][9] A 2007 paper in Genetics by David J. Witherspoon et al. concluded that the two arguments are in fact compatible, and that Lewontin's observation about the distribution of genetic differences across ancestral population groups applies "even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used".[10]

Lewontin's argument
Edit
In the 1972 study "The Apportionment of Human Diversity", Richard Lewontin performed a fixation index (FST) statistical analysis using 17 markers, including blood group proteins, from individuals across classically defined "races" (Caucasian, African, Mongoloid, South Asian Aborigines, Amerinds, Oceanians, and Australian Aborigines). He found that the majority of the total genetic variation between humans (i.e., of the 0.1% of DNA that varies between individuals), 85.4%, is found within populations, 8.3% of the variation is found between populations within a "race", and only 6.3% was found to account for the racial classification. Numerous later studies have confirmed his findings.[6] Based on this analysis, Lewontin concluded, "Since such racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance either, no justification can be offered for its continuance."

This argument has been cited as evidence that racial categories are biologically meaningless, and that behavioral differences between groups are not caused by genetic differences.[7] One example is the "Statement on 'Race'" published by the American Anthropological Association in 1998, which rejected the existence of races as unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups.[11]

Edwards' critique
Edit
See also: Race and genetics
Edwards argued that while Lewontin's statements on variability are correct when examining the frequency of different alleles (variants of a particular gene) at an individual locus (the location of a particular gene) between individuals, it is nonetheless possible to classify individuals into different racial groups with an accuracy that approaches 100 percent when one takes into account the frequency of the alleles at several loci at the same time. This happens because differences in the frequency of alleles at different loci are correlated across populations—the alleles that are more frequent in a population at two or more loci are correlated when we consider the two populations simultaneously. Or in other words, the frequency of the alleles tends to cluster differently for different populations.[12]

In Edwards' words, "most of the information that distinguishes populations is hidden in the correlation structure of the data". These relationships can be extracted using commonly used ordination and cluster analysis techniques. Edwards argued that, even if the probability of misclassifying an individual based on the frequency of alleles at a single locus is as high as 30% (as Lewontin reported in 1972), the misclassification probability becomes close to zero if enough loci are studied.[13]

Edwards' paper stated that the underlying logic was discussed in the early years of the 20th century. Edwards wrote that he and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza had presented a contrasting analysis to Lewontin's, using very similar data, already at the 1963 International Congress of Genetics. Lewontin participated in the conference but did not refer to this in his later paper. Edwards argued that Lewontin used his analysis to attack human classification in science for social reasons.[13]

Support and criticism
Edit
Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins discusses genetic variation across human races in his book The Ancestor's Tale.[5] In the chapter "The Grasshopper's Tale", he characterizes the genetic variation between races as a very small fraction of the total human genetic variation, but he disagrees with Lewontin's conclusions about taxonomy, writing: "However small the racial partition of the total variation may be, if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlate with other racial characteristics, they are by definition informative, and therefore of taxonomic significance."[5] Neven Sesardić has argued that, unbeknownst to Edwards, Jeffry B. Mitton had already made the same argument about Lewontin's claim in two articles published in The American Naturalist in the late 1970s.[14][15][16]

Biological anthropologist Jonathan M. Marks agrees with Edwards that correlations between geographical areas and genetics obviously exist in human populations but goes on to write:

What is unclear is what this has to do with 'race' as that term has been used through much in the twentieth century—the mere fact that we can find groups to be different and can reliably allot people to them is trivial. Again, the point of the theory of race was to discover large clusters of people that are principally homogeneous within and heterogeneous between, contrasting groups. Lewontin's analysis shows that such groups do not exist in the human species, and Edwards' critique does not contradict that interpretation.[7]

The view that while geographic clustering of biological traits does exist, this does not lend biological validity to racial groups, was proposed by several evolutionary anthropologists and geneticists prior to the publication of Edwards' critique of Lewontin.[11][17][18][19][20]

In the 2007 paper "Genetic Similarities Within and Between Human Populations",[10] Witherspoon et al. attempt to answer the question "How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?" The answer depends on the number of polymorphisms used to define that dissimilarity, and the populations being compared. When they analysed three geographically distinct populations (European, African, and East Asian) and measured genetic similarity over many thousands of loci, the answer to their question was "never"; however, measuring similarity using smaller numbers of loci yielded substantial overlap between these populations. Rates of between-population similarity also increased when geographically intermediate and admixed populations were included in the analysis.[10]

Witherspoon et al. write:

Since an individual's geographic ancestry can often be inferred from his or her genetic makeup, knowledge of one's population of origin should allow some inferences about individual genotypes. To the extent that phenotypically important genetic variation resembles the variation studied here, we may extrapolate from genotypic to phenotypic patterns. ... However, the typical frequencies of alleles responsible for common complex diseases remain unknown. The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our finding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population. Thus, caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.[10]

Witherspoon et al. add: "A final complication arises when racial classifications are used as proxies for geographic ancestry. Although many concepts of race are correlated with geographic ancestry, the two are not interchangeable, and relying on racial classifications will reduce predictive power still further."[10]

In a 2014 paper, reprinted in the 2018 Edwards Cambridge University Press volume, Rasmus Grønfeldt Winther argues that "Lewontin's fallacy" is effectively a misnomer, as there really are two different sets of methods and questions at play in studying the genomic population structure of our species: "variance partitioning" and "clustering analysis". According to Winther, they are "two sides of the same mathematics coin" and neither "necessarily implies anything about the reality of human groups".[8</div></div></div><div class="flex

Lewontin and Edwards is complex and touches upon various issues related to the interpretation of genetic data and its application to human classification. Here's a summary of the main points:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Richard Lewontin</strong> argued that genetic differences within racial groups are greater than differences between racial groups. He concluded that the classification of humans into races based on genetics has little scientific validity. This idea, also referred to as Lewontin's Fallacy, has been influential in the debate about race and genetics.</p></li><li><p><strong>A. W. F. Edwards</strong>, in his critique of Lewontin's argument, stated that while individual genetic loci cannot accurately classify an individual's race, taking into account multiple genetic loci allows for near-perfect classification. Edwards contends that this indicates the biological reality of race, challenging Lewontin's conclusion.</p></li><li><p>A number of scholars, such as Jonathan Marks and Rasmus Grønfeldt Winther, argue that Edwards' critique doesn't contradict Lewontin's argument. The basic point of contention revolves around what constitutes significant and meaningful genetic variation.</p></li><li><p>A paper by <strong>David J. Witherspoon et al.</strong> suggests that both Lewontin's and Edwards' arguments can coexist: it is possible to often correctly infer an individual's race from their genetics, while also acknowledging that there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them.</p></li><li><p>Overall, there is significant debate over whether genetic differences can justify racial classification. Some, like Richard Dawkins, acknowledge the existence of genetic differences between races, but question their significance. Others, like Jonathan Marks, argue that while geographical and genetic correlations exist, they do not lend validity to distinct biological races.</p></li><li><p>The debate has implications for understanding genetic diseases, where racial or geographic origin might play a part in the prevalence or nature of certain diseases. But as Witherspoon et al. point out, more research is needed to better understand the frequencies of alleles responsible for common complex diseases.</p></li><li><p>A key issue is that concepts of race and geographic ancestry are often conflated, even though they are not interchangeable. This complicates the interpretation of genetic data in relation to human classification.</p></li></ol><p>This discussion raises important questions about the interpretation of genetic variation and its implications for human classification, highlighting the complexity and ongoing nature of the debate around race and genetics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

Review articles
The background and legacy of Lewontin's apportionment of human genetic diversity
John Novembre
Published:18 April 2022https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2020.0406
Abstract
Lewontin's 1972 article ‘The apportionment of human diversity’ described a key feature of human genetic diversity that would have profound impacts on conversations regarding genetics and race: the typical genetic locus varies much less between classical human race groupings than one might infer from inspecting the features historically used to define those races, like skin pigmentation. From this, Lewontin concluded: ‘Human racial classification … is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance’ (p. 397). Here, 50 years after the paper's publication, the goal is to understand the origins and legacy of the paper. Aided by insights from published papers and interviews with several of Lewontin's contemporaries, I review the 1972 paper, asking about the intellectual background that led to the publication of the paper, the development of its impact, the critiques of the work and the work's application and limitations today. The hope is that by gaining a clearer understanding of the origin and reasoning of the paper, we might dispel various confusions about the result and sharpen an understanding of the enduring value and insight the result provides.

This article is part of the theme issue ‘Celebrating 50 years since Lewontin's apportionment of human diversity’.

1. Introduction
And so I thought, ‘Well, we've got enough of this data, let's see what it tells us about the differences between human groups’. And so I just looked into the literature, and that literature was in books and so on.
[O]ne day I was going to give a lecture, I think it was in Carbondale, Illinois, or somewhere south. I was working in Chicago at the time. So I took a couple of these books with me and a pad of paper, and a table of logarithms which I needed for this purpose, and a little hand calculator, and I sat on this bus trip for three or four hours looking at the books, picking out the data, looking it up in the table of logarithms, doing a calculation, and writing it down in tables. And when I got back after the round trip I had all the data I needed to write the paper about how much human genetic variation there was, and so I did it. […]
Shows you it's worthwhile being afraid to fly, by the way, because you have lots of time on a bus to work. – R.C. Lewontin, Interview for ‘Race the Power of an Illusion’ Documentary [1]
With this story, Lewontin describes the origins of his paper on ‘The apportionment of human diversity’ [2], a paper that would go on to have profound impacts on perceptions of human genetics and race, with key phrases from the paper echoing for decades across disciplines to the present day.

As is well known, the paper showed that at a typical genetic locus 85% of ‘[genetic variation is found within human groups]' and on that basis he concluded that ‘human races and populations are remarkably similar to each other with the largest part by far of human variation being accounted for by the differences between individuals’ and from this he judged that ‘Human racial classification is now seen to be of virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance’. The paper's main result is routinely cited in antiracist perspectives on race and genetics and has been featured in some of the most widely distributed public translations of genetic results (e.g. [1,3]).

Here, 50 years after the paper's publication, the goal is to understand its origins and legacy, including the nature of the critiques and concerns with it, and ultimately what power and limitations it has in discussions about genetics and race. Aided by insights from published papers and interviews with several of Lewontin's contemporaries (see Acknowledgements), I review the 1972 paper, asking about the intellectual background that led to the publication of the paper, the development of its impact, the critiques of the work and its enduring relevance. This review also benefits greatly from insights provided by other perspectives on Lewontin's 1972 [2] paper (e.g. [4–6]), including an edited volume on the papers of Anthony Edwards [7], which contains an excellent interview with Edwards and an especially lucid commentary by Noah Rosenberg [8].</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

background and legacy of Lewontin's apportionment of human genetic diversity," published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences in 2022. Unfortunately, without specific questions or prompts, it's a bit challenging for me to provide a suitable response.</p><p>However, I can summarize this passage:</p><p>This is a review of Richard Lewontin's influential 1972 paper "The apportionment of human diversity". Lewontin's paper is notable for arguing that most human genetic diversity can be found within racial groups, rather than between them, leading him to conclude that racial classification has minimal genetic or taxonomic significance. Novembre's article aims to delve into the context and enduring impact of Lewontin's paper, discussing how it has shaped conversations about genetics and race, and how it continues to be relevant 50 years after its publication. This includes an examination of criticisms of Lewontin's work and its limitations, as well as its enduring relevance.</p><p>If you have specific questions about the content or context of this passage, please provide more details.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">The next section of this review, ‘Background’, situates 
Lewontin’s work in terms of a complex set of antecedents, 
including his now little-known work on the textbook Quanti- 
tative Zoology [9], as well as an interest in information theory 
and debates in evolutionary genetics at the time. The hope is 
that by understanding the foundations of the work, we might 
gain a deeper understanding of the reasoning of the paper, 
and in turn more clearly navigate the subsequent critiques. 
The third section, ‘The results and reactions’, discusses 
how his key result was both supported and contested by sub- 
sequent publications. Many of the critiques criticized a 
conclusion that Lewontin did not in fact draw; the apparent 
critique by Edwards [10] in particular considers a different 
aspect of the taxonomy problem from the one Lewontin 
aimed for and does not invalidate the central insight pro- 
vided by Lewontin’s result. We will see how much of the 
apparent controversy here was due to a confusion about the 
focal question. For Lewontin, the question was not whether 
genetics can be used for studying relationships among indi- 
viduals (i.e. whether genetics can be a basis of taxonomy); 
he was asking rather whether human racial groupings have 
taxonomic significance in the sense that they are predictive 
of meaningful differentiation at a typical genetic locus. 
The fourth section, ‘Lasting legacy’, considers how the 
Apportionment’s key result became a sound bite, so well- 
used that it is at times applied in vague and mistaken ways 
even by its advocates, a slippage that likely invited some of 
the later critiques. Despite its importance, Lewontin under- 
stood that the result does not provide a single answer to all 
arguments about genetics and race. Yet, in showing how 
human genetic differentiation is much lower than one 
would suppose from looking at surface indicators like skin 
pigmentation, the result endures as a key fact about human 
genetic variation that reaffirms that nothing about human 
genetic diversity is as simple as it first appears. Finally, box 
2 on ‘Teaching the result’ gives some insights and references 
on some approaches to teaching the result.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

Background 
(a) In the spirit of Quantitative Zoology? 
Lewontin’s paper was developed at a time when many gen- 
eticists found themselves being called upon to react to the 
controversial writings on genetics and race by Arthur 
Jensen in 1969 [30]. Lewontin himself had written a critical 
response in the Bulletin of Atomic Science already in 1970 
[31] and later wrote similarly motivated pieces, for example, 
in Science in 1975 with Marcus Feldman [32], in the American 
Journal of Human Genetics in 1974 reacting to works by 
Morton and colleagues [33], and much later in 1984 in Not 
In Our Genes [34]. Though the Jensen controversy was likely 
among the motivating factors, the 1972 paper does not con- 
tain any reference to it. 
The paper appears in the 6th volume of a series titled 
EvolutionaryBiology for whichTheodosius Dobzhansky 
(Lewontin’s PhD advisor), Max Hecht and William Steere 
were editors. The volume appears to have been organized, 
at least in part, to honour famed paleontologist George Gay- 
lord Simpson’s 70th birthday. The opening piece is a tribute 
to Simpson [35], and many of the articles, though not all, 
begin with tributes to him, including Dobzhansky’s contri- 
butiontothevolume[36].Thevolumealsohasa 
concentration of papers on human variation and evolution: 
the final five papers in the volume are focused on the subject, 
including a contribution by Dobzhansky, who possibly 
invited Lewontin to submit to the volume. One of those 
five human-oriented papers was titled ‘Polygenic inheritance 
and human intelligence’ [37], though its author, Michael 
Lerner, tried explicitly not to discuss the ongoing controver- 
sies about human genetics and race. Dobzhansky himself 
had long been steeped in discussion about the taxonomic 
value of the race classification, defending a concept of race 
in biology and its applicability to humans [38]. 
Whether Dobzhansky and the other editors were seeking 
a piece from Lewontin that might honour Simpson and/or 
address genetics and race in humans is unclear. Lewontin 
and Simpson likely interacted when they were both at 
Columbia in the early 1950s, and while relatively unknown 
today, Lewontin had a substantial collaboration with Simp- 
son. In 1960, Simpsonand Lewontin co-authored the 
second edition of the textbook Quantitative Zoology, along 
with Simpson’s wife Anne Roe [9]. 
First published in 1939, the book teaches a rigorous, 
numerical approach to questions in biology, including taxon- 
omy. Lewontin was added as an author for the 1960 edition 
due to his expertise in biometrics, a field that had blossomed 
since the original publication of Quantitative Zoology. The new 
edition added a chapter on the analysis of variance (‘This 
must now be considered an essential and basic technique in 
Quantitative Zoology’ p. vi), which Lewontin most likely 
wrote given the style and themes that it emphasizes. 
As an application of the analysis of variance, the chapter 
describes how ‘a problem common in experimental taxon- 
omy is that of distinguishing geographical races’ (p.304). 
Though it is not explicit about defining criteria for races, it 
presents an example from Drosophila persimilis from three 
geographical localities in western North America. Unlike 
what he would later find for human groups, the genetic var- 
iance in bristle number across localities was estimated to be 
about 4-fold larger than that between individuals. As the 
chapter explains ‘The reasonable conclusion from the analysis 
is that the populations […] are genetically different and con- 
stitute distinct geographical races (under one commonly 
accepted criterion of race).’ (p.304) 
Though differing in detail (using indirect estimates of 
genetic variance in an example trait versus direct observation

of genotypic data) and imprecise in defining a criterion for 
race, the approach foreshadows Lewontin’s work on human 
genetic diversity in the 1972 Apportionment paper. Both 
works apportion variances to make evaluative statements 
about taxonomic categories. The working logic is that a 
meaningful taxonomic assignment (e.g. of individuals into

In appreciating the insight that Lewontin’s result provided, it 
is important to understand its limits. 
The 1972 paper did not convey concretely how traits 
might vary across groups. Later works by several others 
extended the implications of Lewontin’s work to quantitative 
traits (see [98,99] and references therein). Interestingly, in 
simple models, the same apportionment of diversity seen at 
single loci should hold for strictly neutrally varying quantitat- 
ive traits (i.e. traits whose variants have no pleiotropic fitness 
effects). This supports Lewontin’s view in that, for a species 
with an apportionment of genetic diversity like that of 
humans, one should expect neutrally varying traits to not 
greatly differ between populations either. 
That said, elevated differentiation between human groups 
in genetic variation underlying traits can arise for several 
reasons: if the loci underlying a trait have experienced geo- 
graphically variable selective pressures (as seen with skin 
pigmentation loci), or less obviously, in various cases where 
there is stabilizing selection on a trait, even when there is a 
single optimum shared between species (e.g. [100,101]). Over- 
all, the degree to which variable selective pressures have 
acted on variants underlying human traits is still unknown 
and is often difficult to understand rigorously using tech- 
niques developed to date [101–103]. 
For some of the most controversial traits of interest (such 
as behavioural ones), many practising population geneticists 
think geographically varying selective pressures are unlikely 
and that any differences (due to selection or otherwise) will 
be negligible, especially relative to the rich prior knowledge 
of environmental factors and interactions that can shape 
such traits (Lewontin was a leader in expressing and arguing 
this perspective). Others think that differences between 
groups in some form (selected or otherwise) are more likely 
to exist than not (e.g, ‘it would be a bad bet to argue’ [79, 
p. 258]), and we should prepare society to deal with such 
group differences if they are discovered (reaffirming the 
widely held ethical position of assigning moral equality to 
all individuals), as otherwise pseudo-scientific approaches 
and interpretations would likely lead the discussion of any 
possible differences. 
For Lewontin’s part, he seems to have understood the 
main limitations and the utility of his results [54,72,104]. 
For instance, both are expressed in his Hitchcock lecture at 
Berkeley in 2003 [72]. In the lecture, he acknowledges that 
his work ‘does not prove…that there isn’t a gene some 
place’ that might be important for affecting behaviour and 
that varies across populations. While admitting this, he 
stressed defensively that ‘nobody’s ever found it’ and 
‘there’s no reason to think such things exist’. In a frank 
response to a question about what effect his work may 
have on those with racial prejudices, he expressed ‘it’s not 
clear it has any effect…I have not proved [racially differen- 
tiated genes for IQ] don’t exist….’ He continued, ‘I think 
data like these in large part, predispose one toward an under- 
standing of the situation, but if you’re a hardcore racist 
they’re not going to have any effect at all’. 
As Lewontin knew, his result is not a silver bullet that 
defeats all possible racist positions, but it does set an impor- 
tant prior expectation. On a scientific basis, one can safely 
expect that the average variant is not substantially differen- 
tiated across race groups, and in turn that race is a poor 
proxy for genotype at any one locus of interest. For any dis- 
cussionofhumanvariation,thisisanimportant 
‘understanding of the situation’. 
5. Conclusion 
After considering the controversies and confusions that have 
arisen from Lewontin’s 1972 [2] result, it is clear the statistical 
subtleties of thistopic certainly contributed to the confusion— 
at times it seems like Lewontin and critics like Edwards are 
involved in the proverbial storyof the blindfolded individuals 
describing an elephant where one is feeling the trunk and the 
other the legs. This conciliatory view is not novel [8,105,106], 
though hopefully this article helps convey how the apparent 
disagreements weaken upon inspection. 
While there are many intellectual frameworks to under- 
stand scientific controversies (e.g. [107]), the legacy of 
Lewontin’s paper [2] brings to mind a mode of science pos- 
ited by sociologist of science Aaron Panofsky that he calls 
‘misbehaving science’ [108]. In this mode, controversy is ‘per- 
sistent’, ‘ungovernable’ and ‘political’ and ‘scientists are 
confounded to draw the boundaries between politics and 
science’. And ‘if science is like a machine for resolving contro- 
versies, in misbehaving science that machine is broken’. 
In the context of paper [2] and its legacy, the idea of ‘mis- 
behaving science’ resonates but is not a perfect description of 
the situation. On the one hand, the persistent controversy and 
legacy following [2] seems outside of normal science. For 
example, the early controversies following the 1972 publi- 
cation remerged again thirty years later in 2003. The result 
became a sound bite about race that is sometimes used 
vaguely or in mistaken ways. The existence of a paper titled 
‘Lewontin’s Fallacy’ continues to be used, wrongly, in 
online discussions of race as if Edwards’ paper is a sufficient 
counter-argument to Lewontin’s perspective on the typical 
variant. Rarely do normal scientific results have such a com- 
plex fate and political life. On the other hand, upon close 
inspection, the key scientific controversy falls away, and this 
has been appreciated for a long time (see [105,106] and [8]). 
Science has ‘behaved’ itself in a sense, even though the politi- 
cal controversy and confusions about the implications of the 
science have been persistent. 
Finally, in reflecting on the legacy of Lewontin’s work, I 
hope this narrative has made clear some of the enduring 
and positive aspects of Lewontin’s work. To summarize, his 
work helps us understand that the typical locus in the 
human genome is not as differentiated as one might guess 
from looking at our external features. This does not imply 
that classification using multi-locus genomic data is not poss- 
ible; conversely the ability to use multi-locus data to study 
how individuals genetically relate to one another does not 
invalidate Lewontin’s result and main conclusion. Fifty 
years after the publication, Lewontin’s key empirical claim 
still continues to hold true. We continue to see that for a

typical variant, most variance is found within human groups 
and little is found between them. This fact has never been a 
‘silver bullet’ that ends all discussion of genetics and race. 
Yet, as a critique of race as a useful classification system, it 
still deepens our understanding of human variation, still 
challenges simple interpretations about human differences, 
and helps affirm the willful choice to see past the superficial 
in how we as humans relate to one another.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

think about the English language. It is spoken in many countries around the world, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many parts of Africa and Asia. Now, within each of these countries (consider them as groups), you have a wide array of accents and dialects.</p><p>For example, in the United States alone, you have Southern accents, New York accents, Midwestern accents, and so on. The variation in the way English is spoken within the United States (a single group) is considerable.</p><p>Now, if you compare the English spoken in the United States to English spoken in the UK, Australia, or any other English-speaking country (between groups), you will indeed notice differences. However, these differences may not be as substantial or varied as the differences within each country itself.</p><p>In this analogy, the different dialects and accents of English are like the genetic variants in humans. The individual countries represent different human groups or 'races'. Much like the accents and dialects, most of the genetic variance in humans is found within groups (within a single country in the analogy), rather than between different groups (between different countries in the analogy).</p><p>This means, while there are some genetic differences between different groups or 'races' of people, the differences within each group are usually greater. This reinforces the idea that race, similar to country of origin in our analogy, is a poor proxy for predicting specific genetic variants (like predicting dialect based solely on country).</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

animals such as dogs and cats, let's consider the variability within and between breeds (species) of dogs, as compared to the differences between dogs and cats.</p><p>There is a vast array of dog breeds, from Chihuahuas to Great Danes. Each breed has its own unique characteristics and traits, such as size, coat color and texture, temperament, etc. These differences can be quite substantial, similar to how dialects can vary greatly within a country in the previous analogy. This is an example of the variability within a species (dogs).</p><p>Now, if you compare a dog (let's say a Labrador Retriever) to a cat (like a Domestic Shorthair), you will notice quite a lot of differences. They are, after all, different species with different evolutionary histories, physical characteristics, behaviors, etc.</p><p>However, just like in the human race analogy, even though there are clear differences between dogs and cats, the range of variability within each species (among different dog breeds or among different cat breeds) is also very significant.</p><p>This doesn't mean that we can't tell a dog from a cat (just like we can tell people from different populations apart), but it does mean that trying to predict specific traits based on species alone (i.e., assuming that all dogs or all cats have the same traits) would be overly simplistic and inaccurate.</p><p>In other words, knowing that an animal is a dog doesn't tell you if it's a tiny Chihuahua or a large Great Dane, just as knowing someone's race doesn't tell you their specific genetic characteristics. It's important to remember that diversity within groups can be as significant, if not more so, than diversity between different groups.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

There are indeed some very large cat breeds, such as the Maine Coon, which can reach similar sizes to small dog breeds. Similarly, there are small dog breeds like Chihuahuas that can be smaller than many cat breeds. Just looking at size or weight isn't enough to determine whether an animal is a dog or a cat.</p><p>Similarly, the boundaries between species aren't always clear-cut. Wolves and dogs, for example, are different species but share a common ancestor and are closely related enough to interbreed. In fact, all dogs are believed to have descended from wolves through a long process of domestication.</p><p>This shows again the complexity of biological variation. There's often more variation within groups than between them, and the boundaries between groups can be blurry. This is true whether we're talking about human populations or animal species. Trying to categorize individuals based on a single characteristic (like size, or skin color in humans) can be overly simplistic and potentially misleading.</p><p>Remembering this complexity can help us appreciate the full diversity of life and avoid oversimplified assumptions about different groups, whether they're different races of humans, different breeds of dogs, or different species of animals.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Lions (Panthera leo) and Pumas (Puma concolor), also known as cougars or mountain lions, belong to the family Felidae, making them distant relatives. However, despite being part of the same family, they exhibit distinct characteristics and behaviors.</p><p>The size of these two species varies significantly. Male lions are larger, often weighing between 330 to 550 pounds, while female lions (lionesses) weigh between 265 to 400 pounds. On the other hand, pumas typically weigh between 80 to 220 pounds. However, despite these differences within the Felidae family, these differences are smaller when compared to the difference between a lion or a puma and a species from another family, such as a wolf (Canis lupus) or a dog (Canis lupus familiaris), both from the Canidae family.</p><p>Similar to the human genetics context we discussed earlier, this represents the fact that most of the genetic diversity or variance is found within species (or families in this case), rather than between them. In terms of appearance and behavior, a lion may have more in common with a puma than with a dog or a wolf. However, within the Felidae family, there can still be substantial differences, just as there are differences between individuals within the same human population group.</p><p>So the principle holds: there is often more variation within groups than between them, and categorizing based on a single characteristic can oversimplify the true complexity and richness of biological diversity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Abstract 
In 1956, evolutionary biologist J.B.S. Haldane posed a question to anthropologists: “Are the biological dif f erences 
between human groups comparable with those between groups of domestic animals such as greyhounds and 
bulldogs…?” It reads as if it were posted on social media today. The analogy comparing human races to dog breeds 
is not only widespread in history and pop culture, but also sounds like scientif i c justif i cation for eschewing the social 
construction of race, or for holding racist beliefs about human nature. Here we answer Haldane’s question in an ef f ort 
to improve the public understanding of human biological variation and “race”—two phenomena that are not synony- 
mous. Speaking to everyone without expert levels of familiarity with this material, we investigate whether the dog 
breed analogy for human race stands up to biology. It does not. Groups of humans that are culturally labeled as “races” 
dif f er in population structure, genotype–phenotype relationships, and phenotypic diversity from breeds of dogs in 
unsurprising ways, given how artif i cial selection has shaped the evolution of dogs, not humans. Our demonstration 
complements the vast body of existing knowledge about how human “races” dif f er in fundamental sociocultural, 
historical, and political ways from categories of nonhuman animals. By the end of this paper, readers will understand 
how the assumption that human races are the same as dog breeds is a racist strategy for justifying social, political, and 
economic inequality.

Background 
Dogs factored greatly into Darwin’s conception of evo- 
lution (Townshend 2009) and he specif i cally pondered 
the similarities of human races and dog breeds in Th e 
Descent of Man (1871). As an integral and inf l uential 
player in Darwin’s legacy, evolutionary biologist J.B.S. 
Haldane posed a question to a group of anthropologists 
at the Royal Society in 1956 that reads as if it were posted 
on social media today: “Are the biological dif f erences 
between human groups comparable with those between 
groups of domestic animals such as greyhounds and 
bulldogs…?” 
In the U.S., and likely beyond, the human race-dog 
breed analogy is not merely an academic question about 
patterns of variation; today, it factors substantially into 
the popular debate about whether race is fundamentally 
biological as opposed to a social construct, and it carries 
forward an ugly American tradition. Inherent to the anal- 
ogy is the transference of beliefs about pure-bred dogs 
onto notions of human racial “purity” (e.g. Castle 1942; 
Harrington 2009), which helped U.S. legislators pass 
anti-miscegenation laws in the early twentieth century 
(Lombardo 1987). In 2016, Mother Jones demonstrated 
how mainstream and persistent the analogy is when they 
published their interview with a leading white suprema- 
cist who equated human races to dog breeds&nbsp;(Harkinson 
2016). Th e American familiarity with dogs helps make 
their relevance to human “race” seem natural. It sounds 
like science, but as we demonstrate below it is not. 
Here we investigate how the biological variation among 
dogs and humans compare and contrast, answering Hal- 
dane’s question while rebuking the illegitimate appeal 
to science and the erroneous “logic” of the widespread

analogy. To start, we compare genotypic and phenotypic 
variation within and between human groups and within 
and between dog breeds. After we demonstrate the fun- 
damental biological dif f erences between patterns of vari- 
ation in the two dif f erent species (parts 1, 2, and 3), as 
well as the fundamental distinctions between “race” in 
humans and dog breed categories (part 4), we discuss the 
sociocultural signif i cance of this analogy and the impor- 
tance of its refutation (parts 4 and 5). Th at is, a goal of 
this paper is to reveal why equating the category we cul- 
turally call “race” to patterns of human biological varia- 
tion is non-sensical and equating “race” to the categories 
we know for dogs is pernicious and racist, despite the 
comparison appearing obvious to many individuals. We 
counter the seemingly innocent belief that because dogs 
are distinguishable, on sight, by breed that therefore 
human racial categories are just as biologically-based. As 
many readers know all too well, the breed-race analogy 
sits in close cultural and mental proximity to the non- 
innocent racism that lowers targeted minorities to the 
status of nonhuman animals (see Weaver 2013). Readers 
are urged to consult the vast and rich literature discuss- 
ing the cultural-historical-political context of catego- 
rizing humans, and the social construction of the race 
concept, including and especially by scientists, some of 
which we cite throughout this paper (e.g. Sussman 2014; 
Marks 2012a, b, 2017; Brace 2005; Koenig et&nbsp;al. 2008; and 
many others). Th is context is imperative, but that the 
race-breed analogy persists means that there are individ- 
uals who are either unfamiliar with that knowledge or are 
unconvinced by it, perhaps willfully so.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

The authors argue that the comparison often made between human races and dog breeds is not only biologically incorrect, but also harmful and inherently racist.</p><p>This analogy is often used to try and provide a scientific basis for race as a biological concept, similar to how dog breeds are differentiated. However, the authors argue that the concept of 'race' in humans and 'breeds' in dogs have very different underpinnings and implications.</p><p>In the case of dogs, breeds have been artificially selected for specific traits over a relatively short period of time (a few hundred years). This intense selection has led to clear genetic and phenotypic differences between breeds, but it is important to note that these breeds were artificially created by humans. This is very different from the way that humans have evolved.</p><p>In humans, while there are certainly genetic differences between individuals and populations, these differences do not map neatly onto our societal concept of race. In fact, as I mentioned before, there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them. This underscores that 'race' is largely a social construct, rather than a clear biological category.</p><p>Further, the authors of the paper argue that using such an analogy is inherently racist because it can be used to justify social, political, and economic inequality. This can lead to harmful stereotyping and discrimination.</p><p>In summary, the authors of this paper are arguing that human races and dog breeds are not comparable, both in terms of their biological basis and their societal implications. To make such a comparison is not only scientifically incorrect, but also can contribute to harmful and unjust societal structures.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">I did not think that our earlier discussion was racist, I thought the argument of differences between dog breeds and between cats helps show that it race is often an unneeded structure.

It was certainly not my intention. Your use of the analogy between species of cats and breeds of dogs was indeed meant to illuminate the nature of human diversity, which I believe it did.</p><p>To clarify, the paper you shared focuses on a specific analogy often made between human races and dog breeds, an analogy that is sometimes used inappropriately or inaccurately to justify discriminatory beliefs or practices. Our discussion was different and more about general biological diversity.</p><p>It's important to note that human genetic diversity is a beautiful and complex tapestry that can't be accurately captured in rigid racial categories. Similarly, the diversity among cats, dogs, apes, sharks, jellyfish, or trees is a testament to the amazing variety of life on our planet.</p><p>In fact, if you compare humans to other species, you would see that we are all part of the same tree of life, with each species and individual representing a unique branch on that tree. Our shared ancestry and ongoing evolution are what tie us together as part of the natural world. Despite our differences in appearance or behavior, at the genetic level, we are all more alike than different. We share a majority of our genetic material not only with other humans, but also with many other species.</p><p>So, indeed, the diversity we see in other animals can help illuminate our understanding of human diversity. Just as no single characteristic can define a cat or a dog, no single characteristic can define a human. We are each a unique combination of many different traits, shaped by both our genetics and our environment.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex

correct. The diversity we see within a species, like dogs or cats, is generally much larger than the diversity we see within human populations. This is mainly because dogs and cats have been selectively bred for specific traits, creating a vast array of sizes, shapes, colors, and behaviors within a single species. This process is known as artificial selection, where humans intentionally breed animals with desirable traits.</p><p>However, all humans belong to one species - Homo sapiens. There is genetic diversity among humans, but it is much less compared to many other species. This is partly due to a relatively recent common ancestry (in evolutionary terms), as all humans can trace their lineage back to a relatively small population in Africa.</p><p>In contrast, natural selection (the process driving evolution in the wild) tends to work more slowly and is influenced by many complex factors, resulting in the rich tapestry of human diversity we see today. This includes differences in skin color, hair type, body size and shape, and susceptibility to various diseases, among others.</p><p>Despite these differences, it's important to note that genetically, all humans are remarkably similar. In fact, any two humans are about 99.9% identical in their genetic makeup. This reflects our recent common ancestry and the fact that we are all part of a single, interconnected human family.</p><p>Your analogy is therefore accurate in highlighting that there is indeed greater variation within dog or cat breeds than there is within human populations. Comparing this to human diversity helps underline the point that 'race' in humans is a social construct with no clear-cut biological basis, rather than a reflection of significant genetic differences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

1972. He noted that while humans are remarkably similar genetically, there is a surprisingly high level of genetic differentiation between populations. This paradox can be summarized as follows: Despite the fact that most genetic variation in humans (and many other species) can be found within populations rather than between them, the small amount of genetic difference between populations can still produce noticeable physical differences.</p><p>Lewontin found that about 85-90% of all genetic variation could be found within a single population, while only 10-15% of genetic variation distinguished different groups or 'races'. This suggests that the concept of race in humans is largely a social construct, rather than a reflection of any fundamental genetic differences.</p><p>This paradox isn't unique to humans. Many other species show similar patterns of genetic variation, which suggests that our understanding of genetic differentiation and speciation might not be complete. This is a topic of ongoing research in evolutionary biology.</p><p>Coming back to your original discussion, Lewontin's Paradox underlines the point that despite visible differences between human populations, genetically we are much more alike than different. This is somewhat similar to the point you made earlier - there is indeed more genetic diversity within breeds of dogs or cats than there is between different human populations.</p><p>In other words, while we can see noticeable differences between different dog breeds or cat species, the genetic differences between human 'races' are relatively minor. This reinforces the understanding that race, as it is commonly understood, has limited biological significance, and is more accurately viewed as a social construct.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">What about the Lives of a Cell, by Lewis Thomas?

Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher" is a collection of 29 essays written by Lewis Thomas, an immunologist, poet, etymologist, and educator, among other things. The book was originally published in 1974 and became widely appreciated for its insightful and eloquent musings on biology, humanity, and the natural world.</p><p>Each essay in the book covers a range of topics including biology, medicine, music, etymology, and more. Despite the diversity of topics, the essays are interconnected with a central theme: the interconnectedness of all things. Thomas applies this concept both to biological systems, such as cells and ecosystems, and to broader human experiences, arguing that all life and knowledge are deeply interwoven.</p><p>One of the most famous essays in the book, from which the collection gets its title, explores the idea of Earth as a single cell, with humanity and other forms of life serving as components of that cell's complex structure.</p><p>It's important to note that while the book delves into scientific topics, it's not a textbook; rather, it's a reflective and philosophical exploration of life from a biological perspective. It's often recommended for those interested in a humanistic and poetic view of science.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

Here are a few ways we could relate it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Interconnectedness and Diversity</strong>: Just like the variation within dog breeds, cat species, and human races, the entities within a cell—proteins, organelles, DNA—all vary significantly, yet they work together as one unit, the cell, to sustain life.

analogy suggests that there may be unintended negative 
consequences of using artif i cial selection as a model for 
teaching natural selection. Since artif i cial selection can 
produce relatively discrete between group variation and 
low heterozygosity in a short period of time, perhaps 
models of artif i cial selection as teaching tools are inap- 
propriate for middle or high school biology education. 
For example, these models could skew students’ percep- 
tions of what real biological variation would look like if 
produced by other evolutionary processes (genetic drift, 
migration, dispersal, isolation by distance, selection, non- 
random mating, etc.). Perhaps the answer is not to take 
artif i cial selection out of curricula (because dogs, cats 
and other familiar organisms make for engaging peda- 
gogy), but to explicitly and rigorously juxtapose it against 
the rest of evolution. For example, hands-on activities 
that explore the dif f erent ways that evolutionary forces 
such as selection, gene fl ow, and drift (e.g. Lee et&nbsp;al. 2017) 
can af f ect population variation can be used as a&nbsp;produc- 
tive starting point to contrast the ef f ects of natural and 
artif i cial selection. 
Concluding remarks 
h is paper bridges academic literature and popular cul- 
ture. In reaction to notions of race as a “social construct,” 
non-experts may feel justif i ed in holding the oppos- 
ing belief that race is just biology. Not an insignif i cant 
proportion of Americans refuse mainstream academic 
knowledge; our paper of f ers a way forward for those 
caught up in that culture regarding race. Th is paper is 
not primarily for the fanatics who are unlikely to change 
their views, but instead it is for onlookers who might be 
so unfamiliar with these issues that they are either sus- 
ceptible to unscientif i c and/or racist thinking or they are 
under-equipped to refute it. Th e dog breed-human race 
analogy is destructive; if folks see how it does not stand 
up to biology, then maybe they will better understand the 
complexity and signif i cance of race. Several decades ago, 
well before most of the research we cited here was pos- 
sible, Montagu (1942)&nbsp;covered familiar territory: 
“Man has bred dogs for certain temperamental 
qualities useful in the hunt for many centuries. Th e 
Irish setter, for example, is always red-haired, but 
his red hair has no connection with his temperamen- 
tal qualities. Th e Irish setter has the same kind of 
temperament as the English setter, but the hair color 
of the English setter is white and black. Th e only dif- 
ference between the white, the black, the white and 
black, and the red setters is in their coat color; there 
are no signif i cant dif f erences in their mental or tem- 
peramental qualities. No one ever asks whether there 
are mental and temperamental dif f erences between 
white, black, or brown horses—such a question 
would seem rather silly. When, however, it comes to 
man, the prejudice of anyone who has ever made the 
statement that skin color is associated with mental 
capacity is accepted as gospel. For such an assump- 
tion there is about as much justif i cation as there 
would be for the assumption that there exist sub- 
stantial dif f erences between dif f erent color varieties 
of setters. We know this to be false concerning setters 
only because we have paid more unprejudiced atten- 
tion to the mental qualities of dogs than we have to 
those of human beings. ” (1942; p. 92–3) 
h ough we have no way of predicting whether what 
we have presented here will make an improvement [“as 
if all we had to do (refute racists) would be to teach them 
some population genetics” (Marks 2010; p. 272)], we felt 
compelled to try. Scholars and critics may assert that 
because science has a history of encouraging racialism, 
scientif i c racism, and racist appeals to science, then sci- 
ence should step aside in this endeavor. But we believe 
that racist appeals to science deserve scientif i c rebukes, 
at least as one kind of strategy among many. 
While we have attempted here to address one very 
specif i c belief about human variation, it is embedded in 
widespread, biased assumptions about dogs and within 
a dauntingly complex history of science and its socio- 
cultural consequences. Anthropologists, evolutionary 
biologists, geneticists, scientists, scholars, academics, 
teachers, writers, journalists, parents, and citizens must 
move the popular conception of human evolution and 
human variation past the days of Blumenbach and Dar- 
win. To do so means to question not just what we think 
we know about ourselves but what we think we know 
about everything around us too. Being so familiar and so 
widely adored, dogs have signif i cant potential to untether 
racism from evolutionary biology, for good. Toward 
that end, we showed that the categories we impose on 
humans and dogs are dif f erent in important ways, and 
that the comparison lends no science to racism. Equat- 
ing the dif f erences between two human beings to the ide- 
alized dif f erences between a greyhound and a bulldog is 
the province of poetry or prejudice, not science.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

dog breeding) directly to human population structure and using them to support or propagate potentially harmful beliefs about human "races."</p><p>The text highlights several key points:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Artificial Selection and Natural Selection</strong>: Using artificial selection (as in dog breeds) to teach about natural selection might inadvertently suggest that extreme differentiation and low genetic diversity can arise quickly—something that doesn't accurately represent the slower, more nuanced process of natural selection. This can skew students' perceptions of biological variation and evolution.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Race-Dog Breed Analogy</strong>: The comparison between dog breeds and human races is flawed and can be potentially harmful. Dog breeds are the result of very recent, strong, artificial selection for particular traits, while humans have evolved over much longer timescales, with more genetic mixing and subtler selection pressures. The notion of "race" in humans is a social construct that doesn't neatly map onto clear genetic or biological differences.</p></li><li><p><strong>Teaching Genetics and Evolution</strong>: Educators should emphasize the difference between artificial and natural selection and explore the nuances of how various evolutionary forces (such as genetic drift, gene flow, and selection) shape population variation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Scientific Rebuke to Racism</strong>: Although science has historically been misused to propagate harmful racial ideologies, it can and should be used to debunk such misconceptions. As knowledge continues to progress, it's crucial to advance popular understanding of human variation and evolution beyond outdated and potentially harmful concepts.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Role of Everyone</strong>: Everyone, including scientists, educators, journalists, parents, and the general public, has a role to play in advancing our understanding of human diversity and in challenging misinterpretations and misapplications of biological concepts that can fuel prejudice and discrimination.</p></li></ol><p>The piece ends with a strong statement that equating the differences between two human beings to the differences between dog breeds is a province of poetry or prejudice, not science, which nicely sums up the overall argument against the misuse of the dog breed-human race analogy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

living things because we all share a common ancestor if you go back far enough in evolutionary time. However, the percentage of DNA that humans share with other species decreases as you move further away from us on the tree of life.</p><p>Here are some approximate figures:</p><ul><li>Chimpanzees, our closest relatives, share about 98-99% of our DNA.</li><li>Mice, mammals like us but more distantly related, share about 85% of our DNA.</li><li>Chickens, also vertebrates but from a different class (birds), share about 60% of our DNA.</li><li>Fruit flies, further removed from us (they are insects), share about 60% of the genes but not necessarily the exact DNA sequence.</li><li>Zebrafish, a type of fish, share about 70% of genes with humans.</li><li>Roundworms, much simpler organisms, share about 21% of our DNA.</li><li>Plants like Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of flowering plant, share about 18% of genes with humans.</li><li>Baker's yeast, a unicellular organism, share about 26% of genes with humans.</li></ul><p>Regarding species you asked for:</p><ul><li>Whales, being mammals, likely share a high percentage of DNA with humans, although I don't have an exact figure. It's likely to be over 80%.</li><li>Trees, being plants, will share less DNA with humans, although again, the exact percentage will depend on the species. As mentioned above, Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of flowering plant, shares about 18% of genes with humans, so trees might be in a similar ballpark.</li><li>Jellyfish, being much simpler organisms, will share even less DNA with humans. One estimate suggests that humans and jellyfish share about 40% of their genes.</li></ul><p>Remember, these numbers don't mean we are 40% jellyfish or 85% mouse. These shared genes often perform basic biological functions that are common across many forms of life, so it's not surprising that we share them with many other organisms. However, even small changes in DNA can lead to big differences in the organism's form and function.</p><p>Also, it's important to note that a significant portion of our DNA doesn't code for proteins (noncoding DNA or "junk" DNA), and the percentages given above largely consider the coding regions of our DNA, the ones that give rise to proteins and influence our traits.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the comparison is often made on the basis of genes (not overall genome) we share with these species. The degree of shared DNA can vary significantly depending on how the comparison is made. Comparisons of whole genomes can result in lower percentages of shared DNA, while comparisons of individual genes that exist in both species can show very high levels of similarity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Let's add extremephiles and bacteria.

organisms, including bacteria and extremophiles. Moreover, many of these values are not perfectly defined, and different studies may provide different percentages based on methodology, criteria for comparison, and recent advances in genomics. However, here's an approximate scale for the percentage of DNA that humans share with other life forms:</p><ul><li>Bacteria (E.coli): ~10%</li><li>Extremophiles like Thermus aquaticus (a bacterium): ~10% (Approximation similar to other bacteria)</li><li>Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae): ~26%</li><li>Roundworm (Caenorhabditis elegans): ~21%</li><li>Fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster): ~60%</li><li>Zebrafish (Danio rerio): ~70%</li><li>Chicken (Gallus gallus): ~60%</li><li>Mouse (Mus musculus): ~85%</li><li>Dog (Canis lupus familiaris): ~84%</li><li>Whale (specific species not mentioned): Likely &gt;80% (exact figure not available)</li><li>Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes): ~98-99%</li></ul><p>This list should be considered as an estimation as the exact percentage can vary depending on the methods of measurement and which parts of the genome are being compared. This list also does not account for differences in gene expression, which can significantly impact how similar organisms are to each other.</p><p>Please note that these values typically refer to the percentage of genes with a recognizable counterpart in the other genome, or to the percentage of base pairs that align with a counterpart in the other genome. Even when genes or base pairs align, there may still be differences in the exact sequence, so the actual percentage of exactly identical DNA would be lower. It's also important to understand that sharing DNA doesn't necessarily mean that we are "X% another species." A small change in DNA can lead to significant differences in physical traits, behavior, and other characteristics.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs

This comparison was used as a basis to discuss the concept of race in humans.</p></li><li><p>Genetic Variation in Humans: We delved into the fact that the amount of genetic variation within the human population is less than that within populations of many other species, which emphasizes that race is not a clear-cut or biologically defined concept.</p></li><li><p>Lewontin's Paradox: We discussed this concept which refers to the observation that most genetic diversity can be found within populations, rather than between different populations or races.</p></li><li><p>The Lives of a Cell by Lewis Thomas: We referred to this book, which provides perspective on the interconnectedness of life, from the smallest cell to the entire planet.</p></li><li><p>Lewis's Idea of Gaia Hypothesis: We touched on this theory which proposes that Earth's physical and biological processes are linked to form a self-regulating, essentially sentient, system.</p></li><li><p>The Importance of Teaching about Evolution and Artificial Selection: We talked about the importance of accurate education on these topics to avoid misconceptions, especially those related to race.</p></li><li><p>Genetic Similarities with Other Species: We explored the percentage of DNA that humans share with various species, ranging from chimpanzees to bacteria, highlighting our interconnectedness with the rest of the living world.</p></li><li><p>Racism and Science: We discussed the unfortunate history of scientific racism and the necessity of debunking these misconceptions with accurate, up-to-date information about human genetics and evolution.</p></li></ol></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

In fact, all living organisms share a common ancestor and therefore share some degree of genetic similarity.

Humans share about 98% of their genes with chimpanzees, our closest living relatives. We also share a significant amount of genetic material with other primates, as well as with other mammals and vertebrates. However, it's important to note that genetic similarity does not necessarily translate to similarity in physical or behavioral traits.

When it comes to the concept of race, there is no biological basis for dividing humans into distinct racial groups. While there may be some genetic differences between different populations of humans, these differences are relatively small and do not correspond to traditional racial categories. Moreover, the genetic differences between individuals within a given racial group are often greater than the differences between different racial groups.

In short, genetic similarities between humans and animals are a result of our shared evolutionary history and do not have any bearing on the concept of race. The idea of dividing humans into distinct racial groups is a social construct that has been used to justify discrimination and oppression throughout history. It is important to recognize and reject this harmful and unfounded concept.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

Just to summarize, you touched upon these key ideas:</p><ol><li><p>Genetic Similarities with Other Species: Humans do share a significant portion of their genetic material with various organisms due to our shared evolutionary past. The percentage of shared genetic material reduces as we move from closely related species (like chimpanzees) to more distant ones.</p></li><li><p>Race and Genetics: The concept of race has no strong biological basis. While there are genetic variations in the human species, these variations do not align with traditional racial categories. Moreover, the genetic diversity within a so-called 'race' can be greater than the diversity between different racial groups.</p></li><li><p>The Misuse of the Concept of Race: Historically, the idea of dividing humans into racial groups has been used to justify discriminatory practices and attitudes. It's vital to understand and challenge this harmful misuse of the concept.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, your explanation underlines the importance of understanding genetics and evolution to dispel misconceptions about race and human differences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">I found the article that you are looking for. It is a statement on race and racism by the American Association of Biological Anthropologists (AABA). It was published in 2019 and it summarizes the current scientific understanding of human biological variation and the social and historical context of race and racism. Here is the link to the article: [https://bioanth.org/about/position-statements/aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019/](https://bioanth.org/about/position-statements/aapa-statement-race-and-racism-2019/)

If you want me to summarize the article for you, please use the #summary tag before the text. For example:

#summary
Race does not provide an accurate representation of human biological variation. It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when referencing contemporary human populations. Humans are not divided biologically into distinct continental types or racial genetic clusters. Instead, the Western concept of race must be understood as a classification system that emerged from, and in support of, European colonialism, oppression, and discrimination. It thus does not have its roots in biological reality, but in policies of discrimination. Because of that, over the last five centuries, race has become a social reality that structures societies and how we experience the world. In this regard, race is real, as is racism, and both have real biological consequences.

comparison between variation in human populations and variations in breeds of domestic animals (dogs and cats)</li><li>The misuse of the analogy between human races and dog breeds</li><li>The concept of Lewontin's paradox and its implications for understanding genetic variation</li><li>A brief look at the book 'The Lives of a Cell' by Lewis Thomas</li><li>The genetic similarity of humans with various organisms including whales, trees, jellyfish, extremophiles, and bacteria.</li></ol><p>In short, we have traversed from the topic of race and genetics, compared genetic diversity in humans with domestic animals, looked at our similarities with different organisms, and touched upon the relevance of some scientific literature. An appropriate short title for this conversation might be "Race, Genetics, and Biological Similarities Across Species".</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2F6241bfe48785687ad5d68f5c836fbe6d%3Fs%3D480%26r%3Dpg%26d%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcdn.auth0.com%252Favatars%252Fna.png&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Thanks.

summary of our conversation:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Genetic Similarity Across Species:</strong> We started by discussing the genetic similarity between humans and various forms of life. Humans share around 98.7% of their DNA with bonobos and chimpanzees, 96% with gorillas, 92% with mice, 84% with dogs, about 50% with fruit flies and bananas, and about 18% with yeast. We also touched on genetic similarities with extremophiles and bacteria which are far less, given they are simple and ancient forms of life.</p></li><li><p><strong>Human Diversity vs Dog Breeds:</strong> We compared the genetic diversity within humans and domesticated animals such as dogs and cats. Despite the dramatic physical differences among dog breeds, there is less genetic diversity among all dogs than among humans, emphasizing that physical traits don't always mirror genetic diversity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lewontin's Paradox:</strong> We discussed this genetic principle, which posits that there is more genetic variation within a given human population than between different populations, challenging the biological basis of racial categories.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Lives of a Cell</strong>: We briefly touched on the book by Lewis Thomas and its theme of interconnectedness in the natural world, which reinforces the idea that all life shares a common ancestry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Race as a Social Construct:</strong> We concluded by addressing the misuse of the concept of race, emphasizing that it's a social construct, not a biological reality. Scientifically, there's no clear-cut way to divide humans into distinct racial groups based on genetics.</p></li></ol><p>Our conversation has emphasized that while we can observe a gradient of genetic similarity across different forms of life, these genetic relationships don't always manifest in physical traits or behaviors. It also emphasized the need to understand race as a social construct, rather than a biological reality, and to communicate this understanding effectively to avoid unfounded and potentially harmful beliefs about human diversity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"></div></div><button class="cursor-pointer absolute right-6 bottom-[124px] md:bottom-[120px] z-10 rounded-full border border-gray-200 bg-gray-50 text-gray-600 dark:border-white/10 dark:bg-white/10 dark:text-gray-200"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4 m-1" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="12" y1="5" x2="12" y2="19"></line><polyline points="19 12 12 19 5 12"></polyline></svg></button></div><button class="react-scroll-to-bottom--css-xjbmv-1tj0vk3 scroll-convo" type="button"></button></div></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full border-t md:border-t-0 dark:border-white/20 md:border-transparent md:dark:border-transparent md:bg-vert-light-gradient bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 md:!bg-transparent dark:md:bg-vert-dark-gradient pt-2 md:pl-2 md:w-[calc(100%-.5rem)]"><form class="stretch mx-2 flex flex-row gap-3 last:mb-2 md:mx-4 md:last:mb-6 lg:mx-auto lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl"><div class="relative flex h-full flex-1 items-stretch md:flex-col" role="presentation"><div class="flex flex-col w-full py-[10px] flex-grow md:py-4 md:pl-4 relative border border-black/10 bg-white dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:text-white dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-xl shadow-xs dark:shadow-xs"><textarea id="prompt-textarea" tabindex="0" data-id="request-:r3a:-2" rows="1" placeholder="Send a message" class="m-0 w-full resize-none border-0 bg-transparent p-0 pr-10 focus:ring-0 focus-visible:ring-0 dark:bg-transparent md:pr-12 pl-3 md:pl-0" style="max-height: 200px;
