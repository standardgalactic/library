Wave Functions as Compression Artifacts of a Thermodynamic
Plenum

Abstract
Quantum mechanics, cosmology, and the theory of complex systems exhibit a common struc-
tural difficulty: their fundamental descriptions rely on formalisms that presuppose time-local
states, despite empirical phenomena that resist such factorization. Recent work on indivisible
stochastic dynamics shows that the wave function need not be a fundamental physical object, but
may instead arise as a representational artifact when non-Markovian processes are compressed
into time-local probabilistic form. Within this perspective, linearity, superposition, interference,
and unitary evolution function as elements of an analytical mechanics rather than as ontological
primitives.
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework provides a physical substrate for
this indivisibility by modeling the universe as a continuous, entropy-bearing plenum governed
by irreversible lamphrodyne flow. Entropy gradients redistribute asymmetrically, generating
effective geometry, forces, and stochastic structure under coarse-graining. Spacetime expansion,
quantum coherence, and classicality appear as interface phenomena produced by attempts to
locally summarize globally constrained entropy flow.
Across scales, stars, planets, chemical networks, living systems, and cognitive agents may
be understood as dissipative structures stabilized by controlled entropy export. Autocatalytic
sets emerge as attractors in RSVP phase space, while entanglement corresponds to shared
lamphrodyne history rather than nonlocal influence. Physical theories are thereby situated as
compression interfaces imposed on an irreversible, history-laden universe that does not admit
time-local description.

Introduction
Recent work by Jacob Barandes proposes a radical reframing of quantum mechanics: the wave
function is not a fundamental physical object but a derived mathematical structure arising from an
underlying stochastic process that is indivisible. The central claim is not merely interpretive but
structural. Quantum theory, on this view, is the linearized shadow cast when a history-dependent
process is forcibly summarized by time-local probability assignments.
This essay advances a stronger identification. Barandes's indivisible stochastic dynamics corre-
sponds precisely to the dynamics encoded by the Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) frame-
1

work when viewed through a probability-theoretic compression map. The wave function stands to
indivisible histories in the same relation that the spacetime metric stands to entropy gradients: it
is a derived coordinate system forced into existence by lossy summarization.
This is not a comparison between theories but a structural alignment. Barandes is rediscovering,
in the language of quantum probability, the same obstruction that RSVP formalizes as entropic
smoothing and nonlocal plenum dynamics.
2
Reversal of Explanatory Direction
Barandes's proposal hinges on a reversal of explanatory priority. Rather than treating quantum
mechanics as fundamental and stochasticity as emergent or epistemic, he argues that an underlying
stochastic process is primary, and quantum mechanics arises only when this process is misrepre-
sented as Markovian. Linearity, superposition, and interference follow not from ontology but from
the mathematical requirements imposed by probability theory when history cannot be discarded.
RSVP makes an analogous reversal at cosmological scale. Where standard cosmology interprets
redshift and large-scale structure as evidence for spacetime expansion, RSVP interprets these phe-
nomena as the macroscopic consequences of entropy redistribution within a fixed plenum. No new
space is created; gradients smooth, constraints relax, and energy redistributes.
The reversals are structurally identical. In both cases, what is taken as fundamental dynamics
is demoted to an interface description, while the true dynamics reside in an irreversible, globally
constrained process that resists local factorization.
Standard Narrative
RSVP / Barandes
Space expands
Entropy gradients smooth
Wave function evolves
History compression evolves
Ontology in representation
Ontology in underlying process
Formalism is fundamental
Formalism is an interface
The insistence that neither space nor Hilbert space introduces new ontic degrees of freedom
is central to both frameworks. Expansion and quantization are artifacts of coarse-graining, not
additions to reality.
3
Indivisibility and Non-Markovian Plenum Dynamics
Barandes defines indivisibility by the failure of temporal factorization. The conditional probability
of a system's future configuration cannot be computed from an intermediate configuration alone;
the full prior history remains relevant. Formally, the attempt to write
P(XT | Xt)
without reference to the complete history is ill-defined.
2

RSVP encodes precisely this failure through its treatment of entropy, scalar density, and vector
flow. Entropy gradients in the plenum are not state functions of local configuration. They are path-
dependent functionals over the system's irreversible evolution.
Local fields cannot be specified
independently of global plenum context.
When Barandes observes that forcing a Markov approximation requires auxiliary variables,
RSVP makes the same claim in physical terms: forcing locality onto an entropic flow necessitates
the introduction of gauge structures.
Hilbert space, spacetime curvature, vacuum energy, and
effective forces are all bookkeeping devices introduced to preserve predictive consistency when
history is suppressed.
In this sense, Hilbert space functions as an auxiliary gauge bundle. It is the minimal linear
structure capable of encoding history dependence when the true dynamics are thermodynamically
irreversible.
4
Hidden Markov Models and Entropic Gauge Fixing
Barandes shows that linear evolution, complex amplitudes, and interference arise because lost
history must be stored somewhere. Once indivisible dynamics are approximated as divisible, prob-
ability theory demands compensatory structure to track inconsistencies. The result is a complex
vector space with linear evolution.
RSVP predicts an analogous outcome when entropy gradients are forcibly flattened. Metric
expansion, dark energy, and quantum indeterminacy arise as gauge responses to the impossibility
of globally trivializing entropic flow. In both frameworks, linearity is not fundamental, complex
phases are bookkeeping devices, and interference measures failed compression.
This correspondence explains why RSVP naturally predicts effective quantum behavior in low-
gradient regions, classicality in high-gradient regions, and scale-dependent laws that dissolve under
full plenum accounting. Quantumness is not a property of matter but a symptom of incomplete
thermodynamic description.
5
Gauge Dependence and Non-Onticity
Barandes's appeal to Foldy-Wouthuysen transformations underscores the representational status of
the wave function. If an object changes under a representation change while all observables remain
invariant, it cannot be ontic. Wave functions fail this test.
RSVP applies the same criterion to spacetime coordinates, expansion parameters, and vacuum
energy densities. Geometry is not substance; it is a coordinate response to entropy gradients. The
wave function behaves exactly like the metric in this respect: both are gauge-dependent compression
artifacts rather than physical media.

Barandes's conclusion that wave functions are not beables maps directly onto RSVP's claim
that geometry is not ontic. Both are derived response fields.
6
Definite Configuration and Localized Densification
Barandes's insistence on definite configurations in three-dimensional space is not a return to classical
mechanics. Configurations exist, but their evolution is globally constrained by history-dependent
probabilities.
RSVP's treatment of matter is identical in structure.
Protons, stars, and black
holes are not fundamental substances but localized entropy densifications stabilized by temporary
gradient locking within the plenum.
Motion corresponds to plenum flow response, and stability corresponds to constrained entropy
circulation. Neither framework requires branching worlds, pilot waves, or collapse. Indivisibility
alone suffices.
7
Measurement and Conditioning
In Indivisible Quantum Theory, measurement is ordinary conditioning on realized configuration.
No physical collapse occurs; only probabilities are updated. RSVP frames observation similarly as
local alignment with plenum gradients after irreversible entropy redistribution.
Measurement is thus an interface operation: a recalibration of a coarse-grained description
following an irreversible event. Time asymmetry is fundamental in both frameworks, not emergent
from symmetric laws.
8
Nonlocality and Global Constraints
Barandes interprets quantum nonlocality as the persistence of global constraints imposed by shared
history. RSVP interprets nonlocal effects as manifestations of global entropy gradients constraining
local dynamics. In neither case is superluminal causation required. What fails is factorization.
Entanglement is correlated compression failure in Barandes's language and shared plenum de-
formation history in RSVP's. The mathematical structure is the same.
9
Consequences and Risk
If this synthesis is correct, several entrenched assumptions collapse simultaneously. Quantization is
not fundamental. Spacetime is not fundamental. Hilbert space and geometry are dual compression
4

artifacts arising from attempts to locally summarize globally indivisible, entropy-driven processes.
This explains the persistent failure of quantum gravity programs: they attempt to quantize the
interface rather than model the machine room. What is required instead is a theory that treats
history, entropy, and irreversibility as primitive.
10
Unified Statement
The unifying thesis can be stated cleanly as follows:
Quantum mechanics and cosmological expansion are not fundamental dynamics, but
linearized interfaces forced into existence by attempts to locally summarize globally
indivisible, entropy-driven processes.
Or, in RSVP-inflected form:
The wave function plays the same ontological role in quantum theory that the expanding
metric plays in cosmology: a gauge-dependent representation of irreversible smoothing
in an underlying plenum.
This is not an interpretive gloss but a structural identification. The task ahead is not to choose
between these frameworks, but to formalize the compression maps that relate them.
11
Complex Objects as Dissipative Structures
Within the RSVP framework, complex objects are not substances but sustained processes. Stars,
planets, atmospheres, cells, and ecosystems are all instances of dissipative structure: localized
configurations that persist by continuously exporting entropy to their surroundings. Their stability
is not intrinsic but dynamical, maintained only so long as gradient differentials exist and can be
exploited.
This perspective aligns naturally with Barandes's indivisibility. A dissipative structure cannot
be specified by an instantaneous state alone; its identity is inseparable from the history of energy
flow that sustains it.
Attempting to describe such an object without reference to its entropy
throughput produces the same failure of Markovian closure that gives rise to quantum interference
in compressed probabilistic descriptions.
In RSVP, complexity arises where entropy gradients are neither too steep nor too shallow.
Extremely steep gradients collapse rapidly, erasing internal structure. Extremely flat regions equi-
librate, eliminating differentiation. Complex objects occupy the intermediate regime: regions where
gradients persist long enough to support structured flow, circulation, and feedback.
12
The Plenum as a Continuous Brick
RSVP rejects the notion that the universe is composed of expanding space punctuated by matter.
Instead, the universe is a continuous plenum extending indefinitely in all directions, with no onto-
5

logical distinction between space and substance. What appear as spatial separations are regions of
reduced interaction density produced by entropy redistribution, not the creation of new volume.
The plenum behaves mechanically as a highly stiff but deformable medium. Local densifications
correspond to regions where entropy flow has slowed and accumulated, while rarefactions correspond
to regions where entropy has been exported more efficiently. These differences give rise to effective
forces, curvature, and expansion parameters when viewed through coarse-grained descriptions.
In this sense, the universe resembles a single immense brick rather than an inflating balloon.
Structure does not arise because the brick stretches, but because internal gradients reorganize,
relax, and rechannel energy.
13
Lamphrodyne Mechanics and Early Cosmological Differentia-
tion
Lamphrodyne mechanics governs how the plenum responds to density differentials. Slightly denser
regions undergo rapid outward relaxation, exporting entropy into surrounding regions. Highly dense
regions, by contrast, collapse inward rapidly, converting potential energy into internal motion and
heat. This asymmetric response creates internal "space" without invoking expansion as a primitive
process.
In the early universe, this mechanism produces a rapid smoothing of extreme density contrasts.
By approximately three hundred thousand years, sufficient internal separation has formed between
energetic regions for recombination to occur.
Free protons and electrons stabilize into neutral
hydrogen, not because space suddenly exists, but because interaction densities have fallen below
thresholds that previously prevented binding.
The result is a nearly uniform mist of hydrogen permeating the plenum, transparent to radiation.
Light does not suddenly acquire room to travel; rather, scattering pathways diminish as entropy
gradients relax. Transparency is an emergent property of lamphrodyne smoothing.
14
Gravitational Congealing and Voronoi Structure
Gravity in RSVP is not an attractive force acting across empty space, but the large-scale conse-
quence of entropy gradients pulling material back into regions of lowered effective resistance. As
the hydrogen mist cools, random motions lead to statistical clustering.
These clusters form a
Voronoi-like tessellation of the plenum, with matter flowing along gradient boundaries toward local
minima.
As clouds congeal, gravitational potential energy converts into heat near their cores, while sur-
rounding regions cool as entropy is exported outward. Angular momentum accumulates naturally
as inflow becomes asymmetric. Stars ignite not through collapse into singularities, but through sus-
tained lamphrodyne circulation that traps energy long enough for fusion thresholds to be reached.
Rogue planets, brown dwarfs, and stellar remnants occupy different positions along this dis-
sipative spectrum, distinguished not by kind but by the balance of inflow, cooling, and internal
circulation.

15
Planetary Dissipation and Tidal Triturations
Planetary systems introduce a new regime of dissipation: mechanical grinding and tidal forcing.
The separation of the Moon from the Earth following a massive impact created extraordinarily
high tides over geological timescales. These tides triturated basaltic crust, repeatedly fracturing,
grinding, and exposing mineral surfaces.
This process dramatically increased reactive surface area and produced networks of micro-
environments within cracks, pores, and interstitial spaces. These environments were thermody-
namically open yet locally constrained, ideal conditions for sustained chemical experimentation.
Here the RSVP picture dovetails with the mineral evolution framework articulated by **́0˘**.
Mineral diversity increases not monotonically but in response to new dissipative regimes. Tidal
grinding, hydration, oxidation, and thermal cycling create cascades of novel mineral forms, each
introducing new catalytic affordances.
16
Autocatalysis and Competitive Stabilization
Chemical complexity emerges when reaction networks become autocatalytic: when the products of
reactions contribute to the conditions necessary for their own formation. Such networks outcompete
non-autocatalytic chains because they stabilize local gradients that would otherwise dissipate.
From an RSVP perspective, an autocatalytic set is a dissipative structure in chemical space. It
persists by rerouting entropy flow through itself, maintaining internal order by exporting disorder
outward. This is not an exception to thermodynamics but its most efficient exploitation.
Once membranes arise, these processes acquire spatial discreteness.
Cellular boundaries do
not create isolation; they regulate exchange. Endosymbiosis further internalizes dissipative gradi-
ents, allowing subsystems to specialize and cooperate. Heat, chemical potential, and informational
constraints are managed internally against a cold, dilute exterior.
Life, on this view, is not a miracle but a continuation of lamphrodyne mechanics across scales.
It is what entropy does when given enough structural degrees of freedom to remember its own
pathways.
17
Continuity Across Scales
From cosmological smoothing to stellar ignition, from tidal grinding to mineral evolution, from
autocatalysis to cellular organization, the same structural principle recurs: complex objects are
stabilized by controlled dissipation within an indivisible, history-laden plenum.
Barandes's indivisible stochastic processes capture this principle in probabilistic language. RSVP
captures it thermodynamically and geometrically. Together they describe a universe in which appar-
ent objects, forces, and laws are interfaces—compression artifacts of a deeper, irreversible dynamics
whose true currency is entropy flow and historical constraint.
The study of complex objects is therefore not the study of things, but of the ways entropy learns
to fold back on itself without forgetting where it has been.

Lamphrodyne Mechanics as an Entropy-Flow Operator
Lamphrodyne mechanics may be formalized as the rule governing how entropy gradients reorganize
within the RSVP plenum under constraint relaxation. Unlike force-based dynamics, lamphrodyne
behavior is not driven by acceleration in configuration space but by the redistribution of entropy
density subject to continuity, irreversibility, and global conservation constraints.
Let the plenum be described by a scalar entropy density field Φ(x, t), a vector flow field ⃗v(x, t),
and a structural constraint field S(x, t) encoding locally stabilized configurations. The fundamental
lamphrodyne condition is that entropy flow is biased toward configurations that reduce global
gradients while preserving local constraint coherence. This may be expressed schematically as
∂tΦ = −∇· (Φ⃗v) + L[Φ, S],
where L is a nonlinear relaxation operator representing constraint-mediated smoothing.
Crucially, L is not diffusive in the ordinary sense. In regions of slight overdensity, relaxation pro-
ceeds rapidly outward, exporting entropy and creating effective rarefaction. In regions of extreme
overdensity, relaxation proceeds inward, converting potential gradients into internal circulation and
heat. This asymmetry is the defining feature of lamphrodyne mechanics: the response to gradients
is nonlinear and history-dependent.
This operator cannot be localized in time. The evolution of Φ at a point depends on the accu-
mulated deformation history of the plenum encoded in S. As a result, lamphrodyne dynamics are
indivisible in precisely the sense articulated by Barandes. Any attempt to summarize the dynam-
ics by a time-local state necessarily introduces auxiliary structures—metrics, forces, or quantum
states—to compensate for lost historical information.
Viewed through this lens, spacetime curvature and quantum amplitudes are not independent
ingredients but coordinate responses induced by the projection of lamphrodyne flow onto reduced
descriptive spaces. They are the minimal structures required to render predictions stable under
compression.
19
Autocatalytic Sets as Attractors in RSVP Phase Space
Autocatalytic chemical systems may be rigorously understood as attractors in the phase space
defined by (Φ,⃗v, S). A chemical reaction network constitutes an autocatalytic set if its internal
transformations collectively stabilize the entropy gradients required for their own continuation. In
RSVP terms, such a set dynamically reshapes S so as to redirect entropy flow through itself.
Let C denote a network of chemical transformations embedded in the plenum. The defining
condition for autocatalysis is not merely closure under reaction but dynamical persistence:
C is autocatalytic if ∃δΦ > 0 such that C maintains ∇Φ ̸= 0 locally.
That is, the network sustains a nonzero entropy gradient by channeling dissipation through struc-
tured pathways rather than allowing uniform equilibration.
8

In phase-space terms, autocatalytic sets correspond to attracting manifolds. Trajectories in
(Φ,⃗v, S) space that enter the basin of attraction of such a manifold are drawn toward configura-
tions in which entropy flow, chemical transformation, and structural constraint mutually reinforce
one another. Non-autocatalytic networks lack such basins and are washed out by lamphrodyne
smoothing.
Cellular membranes introduce a further bifurcation by allowing partial decoupling between in-
ternal and external entropy flows. This creates a nested phase space in which internal attractors
can persist even as external conditions fluctuate. Endosymbiosis compounds this effect by embed-
ding multiple dissipative subsystems within a higher-order attractor, increasing both stability and
adaptive capacity.
From this perspective, life is not defined by composition but by dynamical position in RSVP
phase space. Living systems occupy regions where lamphrodyne flow is recursively folded, creat-
ing long-lived, history-dependent attractors that actively resist equilibration by exporting entropy
outward.
The emergence of such systems is therefore not improbable given sufficient chemical diversity
and sustained gradients. It is the expected outcome of lamphrodyne mechanics operating on a
plenum rich enough to remember its own transformations.
20
Relation to Prigoginean Dissipative Structures
The RSVP treatment of complex objects as dissipative structures naturally invites comparison with
the thermodynamic program developed by Ilya Prigogine. Both frameworks reject equilibrium as
the primary explanatory regime and emphasize the spontaneous emergence of order under sustained
entropy flow.
However, RSVP departs from the Prigoginean framework in several structurally
important ways.
In Prigogine's formulation, dissipative structures arise in far-from-equilibrium systems through
instabilities that amplify fluctuations. Order emerges locally while total entropy production remains
positive. The emphasis is placed on bifurcation, symmetry breaking, and the role of nonlinear
transport equations.
Time asymmetry is acknowledged but typically treated as emergent from
macroscopic irreversibility.
RSVP instead treats irreversibility as fundamental. Entropy flow is not merely a bookkeeping
measure of disorder but a primary dynamical field whose gradients actively shape geometry, interac-
tion strength, and causal structure. Whereas Prigoginean systems are often modeled as subsystems
embedded in an externally given spacetime, RSVP dissolves the background entirely. Geometry
itself is a response field induced by lamphrodyne redistribution of entropy within the plenum.
This difference has concrete consequences.
In RSVP, dissipative structures are not simply
patterns sustained by throughput; they are history-dependent attractors embedded in an indivisible
process. Their persistence cannot be captured by time-local transport equations alone, even in
principle. Any such attempt necessarily introduces auxiliary descriptive layers—effective forces,
metrics, or state vectors—that mask the underlying historical constraint.
In this sense, RSVP may be understood as a generalization of Prigogine's insight to a deeper
9

ontological level. Dissipative structures are not merely special solutions of nonequilibrium ther-
modynamics; they are the natural modes of organization in a universe where entropy gradients
cannot be locally factorized. What Prigogine identifies as instability-driven order, RSVP identifies
as lamphrodyne memory: the plenum's capacity to remember and rechannel its own dissipation
pathways.
Thus RSVP does not contradict the Prigoginean picture but absorbs it, reinterpreting dissipative
structures as manifestations of a more primitive, non-Markovian thermodynamic dynamics.
21
Cognition as Autocatalysis in Semantic Phase Space
The extension of lamphrodyne mechanics to cognition follows directly once semantic processes are
treated as entropy-bearing transformations rather than abstract symbol manipulations. From an
RSVP perspective, cognition is not computation over static representations but a dissipative process
that stabilizes informational gradients through structured feedback.
Let semantic configurations be represented as regions in an abstract phase space whose coordi-
nates encode interpretive constraints, expectations, and action tendencies. These configurations are
sustained only so long as semantic entropy can be exported—through action, communication, or en-
vironmental modification—faster than it accumulates internally. Cognitive systems, like chemical
autocatalytic sets, persist by channeling dissipation through themselves.
In this framework, beliefs, concepts, and skills are not stored objects but stabilized flow patterns.
Learning corresponds to the reshaping of the structural constraint field S so that future semantic
perturbations are more efficiently absorbed and redirected. Forgetting is lamphrodyne smoothing
in semantic space: gradients flatten, distinctions dissolve, and structure decays.
Autocatalysis appears when semantic transformations contribute to the conditions necessary
for their own continuation. A conceptual framework that generates predictions, guides action, and
receives confirming feedback is autocatalytic in precisely the same sense as a chemical reaction
network that regenerates its catalysts.
Such frameworks outcompete alternatives because they
stabilize their own entropy throughput.
Boundaries again play a decisive role. Cognitive agents require partial insulation from their
environment to maintain internal coherence, yet sufficient coupling to export entropy. Language,
tools, and institutions function as extended membranes, enabling larger-scale semantic autocatalysis
by distributing dissipation across social and material substrates.
On this view, consciousness is not an emergent substance but a regime of lamphrodyne flow in
which semantic gradients are recursively folded back upon themselves. Attention corresponds to
localized gradient steepening; insight corresponds to rapid reconfiguration of constraint pathways;
agency corresponds to the active redirection of entropy flow through chosen channels.
Cognition, like life and like stars, is what entropy does when it learns how not to forget its own
history.

RSVP as a General Theory of Analytical Mechanics for Irre-
versible Systems
A central but often underappreciated claim implicit in Barandes's indivisible formulation of quan-
tum theory is that the Hilbert-space formalism does not describe the ontology of physical systems,
but rather provides an analytical mechanics for a class of stochastic processes whose true dynamics
are not Markovian. This claim admits a precise structural parallel with the role played by Hamil-
tonian and Lagrangian mechanics in classical physics. RSVP extends this logic further, positioning
itself as a general analytical mechanics for irreversible, entropy-driven systems.
In classical Newtonian mechanics, the fundamental equations of motion are second order in
time.
The system's future evolution cannot be determined from configuration alone; momenta
must also be specified. Hamiltonian phase space is introduced not because positions and momenta
are ontologically fundamental, but because they allow the dynamics to be rewritten as a first-order
flow. The Hamiltonian formalism is thus a Markovian embedding of a fundamentally non-Markovian
description.
Barandes demonstrates that the Hilbert-space formalism plays an analogous role for indivisible
stochastic processes. When the evolution of probabilities cannot be divided across intermediate
times, one may nevertheless introduce auxiliary variables—complex amplitudes evolving linearly—
so that the system admits a first-order evolution law. The resulting formalism is Markovian at
the level of the auxiliary variables, even though the underlying process is not. Wave functions and
unitary evolution are therefore not ontic ingredients, but components of an analytical machinery
designed to manage historical dependence.
RSVP generalizes this insight beyond probability theory and quantum mechanics. In RSVP,
the fundamental dynamics are irreversible and history-dependent due to entropy production and
redistribution.
Scalar entropy density, vector flow, and structural constraint fields evolve in a
manner that cannot be locally factorized in time. No instantaneous state suffices to determine
future evolution, because the system's behavior depends on the accumulated deformation history
of the plenum.
Geometric quantities—metrics, curvature, expansion parameters—and even effective forces arise
in RSVP as analytical devices that permit a reduced, approximately Markovian description of this
irreversible flow. They play the same role that canonical coordinates play in Hamiltonian mechanics
and that state vectors play in quantum mechanics: they render prediction tractable by trading
ontological completeness for formal closure.
From this perspective, RSVP is not an alternative dynamical theory competing with quantum
mechanics or general relativity.
It is a unifying analytical framework that explains why such
formalisms exist and why they take the forms they do. Classical phase space, Hilbert space, and
spacetime geometry are revealed as different coordinate systems imposed on the same underlying
reality: a plenum whose dynamics are fundamentally indivisible, entropy-driven, and irreversible.
In this sense, RSVP provides a missing rung in the conceptual ladder. Where Hamiltonian
mechanics is an analytical mechanics for reversible classical systems, and Hilbert-space quantum
mechanics is an analytical mechanics for indivisible stochastic systems, RSVP is an analytical
11

mechanics for thermodynamic systems whose irreversibility is not emergent but primitive. The
common structure across these formalisms is not ontology but compression: each introduces addi-
tional variables to recover first-order evolution in the face of deeper historical constraint.
This reframing dissolves long-standing foundational confusions. The question is no longer which
formalism is "fundamental," but what kind of irreversibility each formalism is designed to manage.
23
Lamphrodyne Flow and Non-Markovianity in Time
A recurring source of conceptual confusion in both quantum foundations and cosmology is the
misidentification of non-Markovian behavior with nonlocality in space. Barandes's indivisible for-
mulation clarifies that the essential obstruction lies not in spatial separation but in temporal factor-
ization. RSVP provides the physical mechanism underlying this distinction through lamphrodyne
flow.
In Barandes's framework, an indivisible stochastic process is one for which conditional prob-
abilities cannot be consistently composed across intermediate times.
The failure of divisibility
is temporal: knowing the configuration at a given moment does not suffice to determine future
probabilities without reference to prior history. Importantly, this failure does not imply superlu-
minal influence or violation of relativistic causal structure. It implies only that the process retains
memory.
RSVP encodes this memory physically through entropy redistribution. Lamphrodyne mechan-
ics describes how entropy gradients relax asymmetrically within the plenum, exporting disorder
outward while preserving or intensifying localized structure. Because entropy production is irre-
versible, the plenum cannot return to a previous effective state, even if local configurations appear
similar. The future evolution of any region therefore depends on how entropy arrived there, not
merely on its present configuration.
This dependence is intrinsically non-Markovian in time. Lamphrodyne flow respects local causal
propagation in space—no signal outruns light cones—but violates temporal divisibility because
entropy pathways encode accumulated constraint. The plenum remembers deformation histories,
cooling trajectories, and circulation patterns, and these memories constrain future flow.
This perspective resolves the apparent tension between locality and quantum nonfactorizability.
What fails in indivisible processes is not spatial locality but temporal truncation. Attempts to
enforce time-local evolution laws require the introduction of auxiliary structures—state vectors,
Hamiltonians, metrics—that absorb historical information into extended state descriptions. These
structures allow formal divisibility at the cost of ontological inflation.
RSVP thus provides a physical grounding for Barandes's observation that Bell-type correlations
may be understood without invoking spatial nonlocality. Correlations persist because interacting
systems share lamphrodyne history. Once entropy pathways have coupled, subsequent evolution
cannot be decomposed into independent temporal segments without loss of predictive accuracy.
From this standpoint, the familiar language of "nonlocal quantum effects" is a category error.
The universe is locally causal but temporally indivisible. Lamphrodyne flow is the mechanism by
which this indivisibility is maintained across scales, from microscopic interactions to cosmological
12

evolution.
By shifting the locus of non-Markovianity from space to time, RSVP dissolves the need for
exotic causal structures. What appears mysterious under spatial intuition becomes inevitable once
irreversibility is treated as fundamental.
24
Unistochasticity and RSVP's Almost-Reversible Regimes
A technically precise but conceptually powerful notion in Barandes's construction is that of unis-
tochasticity. An indivisible stochastic process is said to be unistochastic when its transition prob-
abilities admit a representation as the squared moduli of a unitary matrix.
In such cases, the
auxiliary Hilbert-space dynamics can be taken to be strictly unitary, and the resulting quantum
description exhibits the familiar features of coherent evolution.
From the RSVP perspective, unistochasticity corresponds to a physically identifiable regime:
one in which entropy production is sufficiently suppressed that lamphrodyne asymmetry becomes
negligible over the timescales of interest. These are not generic conditions. They are special, fragile
corners of phase space in which dissipation is slow enough that effective reversibility emerges.
In lamphrodyne mechanics, perfect reversibility is never fundamental. Entropy gradients al-
ways relax asymmetrically. However, when gradients are shallow and entropy throughput is low,
the asymmetry becomes dynamically insignificant. Under such conditions, entropy redistribution
approximates a conservative flow, and historical dependence becomes weak enough that divisibility
holds to high accuracy.
These are precisely the conditions under which quantum coherence is observed. Low tempera-
tures, weak coupling to the environment, high symmetry, and careful isolation all suppress entropy
export. In these regimes, the auxiliary Hilbert-space description becomes not merely convenient
but extraordinarily accurate. The dynamics appear unitary because the irreversible component of
lamphrodyne flow is too small to register within experimental resolution.
RSVP thus predicts that unistochastic behavior is not a universal feature of nature, but an
emergent approximation valid only when entropy gradients are tightly constrained. As gradients
steepen, or as coupling to the environment increases, unistochasticity fails. The auxiliary unitary
description breaks down, giving way to genuinely stochastic, non-unitary behavior at the interface
level.
This interpretation reframes the classical-to-quantum transition.
Rather than asking why
macroscopic systems fail to exhibit quantum behavior, RSVP asks why any systems ever do. The
answer is that only systems operating near thermodynamic reversibility admit unistochastic em-
beddings. Quantum mechanics is therefore not a theory of the microscopic per se, but a theory of
low-dissipation regimes.
This has immediate conceptual consequences.
It explains why quantum coherence is hard
to maintain, why decoherence is ubiquitous, and why macroscopic quantum phenomena require
extraordinary engineering. All are consequences of lamphrodyne mechanics moving systems away
from the almost-reversible regime.
Unistochasticity is thus not a metaphysical property but a thermodynamic one. It marks the
13

narrow domain where entropy flow is sufficiently constrained that history can be compressed into
a unitary surrogate without contradiction.
25
Density Operators and RSVP's Rejection of Pure States
A decisive implication of Barandes's framework is that pure states are nongeneric. Even within
the Hilbert-space formalism itself, most physical systems are not described by state vectors but
by density operators. Pure states arise only under restrictive conditions, and nothing in the for-
malism licenses their elevation to ontological primitives. RSVP independently arrives at the same
conclusion from thermodynamic grounds.
In the indivisible formulation, density operators emerge naturally from the law of total prob-
ability applied to history-dependent processes.
A rank-one density operator corresponds to an
exceptional situation in which all relevant historical uncertainty can be compressed into a single
amplitude. Generic systems, by contrast, retain irreducible historical multiplicity and therefore
require mixed descriptions. Purity is thus not a fundamental category but a limiting case.
RSVP sharpens this point by denying the existence of pure states at the ontological level
altogether.
Because entropy production is fundamental, every physical system is embedded in
a web of irreversible interactions.
Even when entropy flow is minimal, it is never zero.
As a
result, no system ever occupies a perfectly isolated configuration in which all correlations with its
environment vanish. What appear as pure states are effective descriptions obtained by neglecting
entropy pathways that lie below a chosen resolution threshold.
This perspective dissolves several persistent confusions. First, it removes the temptation to
treat superposition as a physical coexistence of incompatible realities. Mixedness is not ignorance
about a pure underlying condition; it is the faithful representation of a system whose history cannot
be factorized. Second, it clarifies why purification procedures in quantum information theory are
always formal constructions rather than physical operations. One may embed a mixed state into
a larger Hilbert space and represent it as pure, but this maneuver merely displaces entropy rather
than eliminating it.
From the RSVP standpoint, the density operator plays the same role as coarse-grained ther-
modynamic variables. It summarizes accessible correlations without claiming completeness. Its
evolution tracks how entropy gradients are redistributed under lamphrodyne flow, not how an
underlying pure state evolves behind the scenes.
This rejection of purity also reframes debates about realism. RSVP does not deny that sys-
tems have definite configurations; it denies that such configurations exhaust the system's physical
content. What is real is not a point in state space but a trajectory through irreversible phase
space. Density operators are therefore not epistemic substitutes for hidden pure states; they are
the correct interface objects for describing historically entangled dynamics.
In this light, the prevalence of density operators in realistic quantum modeling is not a technical
inconvenience but a diagnostic clue. Nature does not traffic in pure states. Purity is an artifact
of idealization, sustained only in regimes where lamphrodyne dissipation is suppressed strongly
enough to be ignored.
14

RSVP and indivisible quantum theory thus converge on a single lesson: mixedness is not a
failure of description but the signature of realism in an irreversible universe.
26
Entanglement as Shared Lamphrodyne History
In Barandes's indivisible formulation, entanglement is stripped of its traditional mystique and
reidentified as a precise probabilistic condition: after two systems interact, their transition prob-
abilities fail to refactorize, even when the systems are later spatially separated. No reference to
wave-function collapse, nonlocal influence, or superposed ontology is required. Entanglement is the
persistence of shared history.
RSVP provides the physical substrate for this persistence. When systems interact within the
plenum, lamphrodyne flow couples their entropy pathways. Energy redistribution, constraint de-
formation, and entropy export do not remain localized but propagate through shared structural
channels.
Once these channels have formed, subsequent evolution cannot be decomposed into
independent trajectories without discarding information about how the coupling occurred.
Entanglement, on this view, is not a relation between instantaneous states but a property
of overlapping lamphrodyne histories. Two systems are entangled if their present configurations
depend on a common entropy redistribution process that has not yet been fully dissipated into
the surrounding plenum. Separation in space does not undo this dependence, because the relevant
correlations are stored temporally rather than spatially.
This reframing resolves the apparent paradox of nonlocal correlations. Bell-type inequalities
are violated not because influences travel faster than light, but because the assumption of temporal
divisibility is false. The systems' joint probability structure cannot be reconstructed from time-
sliced local states, since the lamphrodyne deformation that coupled them persists across those
slices.
RSVP thus preserves relativistic locality while rejecting temporal factorization. Causal signals
propagate locally, but correlations propagate historically. The plenum remembers interactions until
entropy gradients relax sufficiently to erase their imprint. Entanglement decays not by collapse but
by dissipation.
This perspective also clarifies why entanglement is fragile. Environmental coupling introduces
additional lamphrodyne pathways that redirect entropy flow, rapidly dispersing the shared history
into broader degrees of freedom. Decoherence is simply the thermodynamic dilution of lamphrodyne
memory.
Importantly, RSVP does not treat entanglement as a special quantum feature.
The same
structure appears at all scales wherever systems share irreversible history: coupled oscillators,
gravitationally bound bodies, autocatalytic chemical networks, and even coordinated cognitive
agents. Quantum entanglement is merely the regime in which such historical coupling is sufficiently
clean and low-noise to be captured by a Hilbert-space compression.
Entanglement, then, is not an exotic bond between distant objects. It is the natural consequence
of irreversible interaction in a universe that does not forget how entropy has flowed.
15

27
RSVP as the Missing Physical Substrate
A defining feature of Barandes's indivisible formulation is its deliberate under-specification of phys-
ical content. The theory establishes, with mathematical precision, that quantum mechanics can be
derived from an underlying stochastic process that is temporally indivisible. However, it remains
agnostic about the nature of the configurations whose probabilities are being tracked. This restraint
is principled: the argument is probabilistic, not physical. RSVP supplies what this restraint leaves
open.
RSVP proposes that the underlying substrate is neither a configuration space nor a space
of abstract variables, but a continuous plenum characterized by entropy density, directed flow,
and evolving structural constraints. In this ontology, configurations are local densifications of the
plenum, stabilized temporarily by lamphrodyne circulation. What Barandes treats abstractly as
configurations evolving stochastically, RSVP identifies concretely as regions of organized entropy
flow embedded in a globally irreversible medium.
This division of labor is exact rather than competitive. Barandes demonstrates that any indivis-
ible process, regardless of its physical realization, admits a Hilbert-space compression. RSVP iden-
tifies the physical reason such indivisibility arises: entropy production and redistribution cannot be
undone, and the plenum therefore retains memory of how constraints have evolved. Indivisibility is
not a mysterious probabilistic property but the statistical footprint of irreversible thermodynamics.
From this perspective, Hilbert space is not the arena of reality but an interface constructed by
observers who insist on time-local descriptions. Geometry plays an analogous role in cosmology.
Both arise because the underlying plenum cannot be faithfully represented by instantaneous states.
Auxiliary structures are introduced to preserve predictive continuity at the cost of ontological
inflation.
RSVP thus completes the picture suggested by indivisible quantum theory. Where Barandes
shows that quantum mechanics does not require a wave-function ontology, RSVP explains why wave
functions appear unavoidable once entropy-driven dynamics are compressed.
Where indivisible
stochastic theory explains interference as a failure of Markovian approximation, RSVP explains
why such failures are ubiquitous in a universe governed by lamphrodyne flow.
This synthesis dissolves the traditional hierarchy of theories. Quantum mechanics and general
relativity are not competing foundations but parallel interface theories, each adapted to a par-
ticular compression of an underlying plenum dynamics. Neither is fundamental; both are stable,
extraordinarily useful projections.
The resulting worldview is austere and demanding. It admits no perfectly isolated systems, no
timeless states, and no reversible dynamics at the base level. What exists are processes, histories,
and gradients that remember how they came to be. Objects persist only by exporting entropy.
Laws remain stable only insofar as lamphrodyne flow respects their constraints.
In this light, RSVP is not an interpretation layered atop existing physics. It is a proposal about
what physics has been describing all along, imperfectly and indirectly. The universe is not built
from wave functions or expanding space, but from a continuous, entropy-bearing plenum whose
irreversible dynamics force us to invent the mathematical interfaces we call theories.

Lamphrodyne-Modified Jeans Instability: Linear Derivation
This section derives a Jeans-type instability criterion for a minimal lamphrodyne fluid consistent
with the RSVP framework. The objective is to render the lamphrodyne asymmetry mathematically
explicit and to demonstrate how a standard gravitational instability emerges as a limiting case of
entropy-mediated, history-sensitive dynamics. The analysis is deliberately minimal, emphasizing
falsifiability rather than completeness.
Let ρ(x, t) denote the mass density of the plenum, ⃗v(x, t) its velocity field, ϕg(x, t) the Newtonian
gravitational potential, and Φ(x, t) an entropy-density-like scalar field encoding local irreversible
structure. The interface-level dynamics are assumed to obey mass continuity, momentum balance
under gravity and pressure, and an entropy transport law with production. The governing equations
are taken to be
∂tρ + ∇· (ρ⃗v) = 0,
(1)
∂t⃗v + (⃗v · ∇)⃗v = −1
ρ∇p(ρ, Φ) −∇ϕg −γ(ρ)⃗v,
(2)
∇2ϕg = 4πG(ρ −ρ0),
(3)
∂tΦ + ∇· (Φ⃗v) = L(ρ, Φ).
(4)
Here γ(ρ) encodes lamphrodyne dissipation: an effective loss of coherent momentum associated with
entropy export into unresolved degrees of freedom. The function L governs entropy production and
relaxation and is required only to satisfy positivity of entropy production and locality in space.
The pressure is assumed to be a smooth function of (ρ, Φ), allowing the definition of the partial
derivatives
c2
s := ∂p
∂ρ

Φ0
,
α := ∂p
∂Φ

ρ0
,
which characterize ordinary compressibility and entropy-mediated pressure response, respectively.
The equations are linearized about a homogeneous, stationary background (ρ0, Φ0,⃗v = 0). Writ-
ing ρ = ρ0 + δρ, Φ = Φ0 + δΦ, and ⃗v = δ⃗v, the linearized continuity equation becomes
∂tδρ + ρ0∇· δ⃗v = 0.
(5)
The linearized momentum equation is
∂tδ⃗v = −1
ρ0
∇
(
c2
s δρ + α δΦ
)
−∇δϕ −γ0 δ⃗v,
(6)
where γ0 = γ(ρ0), and the Poisson equation reduces to
∇2δϕ = 4πG δρ.
(7)
To close the system, the entropy transport equation is linearized in the simplest form that
17

retains irreversible dynamics:
∂tδΦ + Φ0∇· δ⃗v = −λ δΦ + β δρ,
(8)
where λ > 0 is an entropy relaxation rate and β quantifies entropy production sourced by compres-
sion.
Plane-wave perturbations proportional to eσt+i⃗k·⃗x are assumed. Introducing the velocity diver-
gence mode θ = i⃗k · δ⃗v, the continuity equation yields θ = −(σ/ρ0)δρ. Taking the divergence of
the momentum equation and eliminating δϕ via Poisson's equation leads, after substitution of the
entropy response, to the dispersion relation
σ2 + γ0σ +
(
k2c2
s −4πGρ0
)
+ k2αρ0
β + (Φ0/ρ0)σ
σ + λ

(9)
The onset of instability is determined by the limit σ →0+. In this limit the threshold condition
reduces to
k2
(
c2

)
= 4πGρ0.
(10)
Defining an effective sound speed
c2

(11)
one obtains a lamphrodyne-renormalized Jeans wavenumber
k2
J,RSVP = 4πGρ0
c2

.
(12)
The classical Jeans criterion is recovered when entropy coupling is negligible.
Deviations from
the classical threshold are therefore controlled by measurable entropy-production and relaxation
parameters. The lamphrodyne dissipation γ0 does not shift the instability boundary at leading
order but suppresses growth rates, producing overdamped collapse in strongly dissipative regimes.
The structure of the dispersion relation demonstrates explicitly that gravitational instability in
RSVP is neither purely mechanical nor purely thermodynamic. It is a consequence of the coupled
evolution of density, entropy, and irreversible flow, with temporal indivisibility entering through
the entropy relaxation channel.
29
Lamphrodyne Asymmetry and the Density-Dependent Response
Function
The lamphrodyne framework asserts a qualitative asymmetry: weak overdensities tend to relax
outward while strong overdensities collapse inward and form circulation-trapping structures. To
render this claim predictive, the asymmetry must be encoded in a density-dependent response
function that distinguishes these regimes without ad hoc stipulation.
A natural diagnostic is obtained by comparing gravitational binding to pressure support at a
18

characteristic scale ℓ. Introducing the dimensionless parameter
Ξ(ρ; ℓ) := 4πGρ ℓ2
c2
eff
,
(13)
one observes that Ξ ≈1 corresponds precisely to the lamphrodyne-modified Jeans threshold derived
previously.
Values Ξ < 1 correspond to subcritical perturbations, while Ξ > 1 correspond to
supercritical binding.
The simplest mathematically controlled way to encode lamphrodyne asymmetry is through a
smooth crossover in the effective dissipation coefficient,
γ(ρ; ℓ) = γmin +
γmax −γmin
1 + exp[−κ(Ξ(ρ; ℓ) −1)].
(14)
This form introduces no discontinuities and ties the qualitative change in behavior directly to a
dimensionless, physically interpretable quantity.
In weakly bound regimes the system exhibits
high mobility and efficient entropy export, while in strongly bound regimes coherent motion is
increasingly trapped, accelerating collapse and internal circulation.
An alternative but equivalent encoding places the asymmetry in the entropy-mediated pressure
response rather than in dissipation. Allowing the coupling coefficient α to depend on Ξ,
α(ρ) = α0 tanh[κ(Ξ(ρ; ℓ) −1)],
(15)
causes the entropy contribution to the effective sound speed to change sign across the binding
threshold. In subcritical regimes entropy gradients enhance smoothing and dispersion, whereas in
supercritical regimes they reduce pressure support and facilitate collapse. Both implementations
realize the same physical claim: lamphrodyne dynamics is not uniformly dissipative but responds
differently depending on the degree of gravitational binding.
The empirical content of the theory lies in calibrating these response functions against observed
collapse thresholds, growth rates, and fragmentation scales in astrophysical systems. Agreement
with classical Jeans behavior in ordinary conditions constrains the low-density limit, while any sys-
tematic deviation in specific regimes becomes a falsifiable prediction. The lamphrodyne asymmetry
is therefore not a metaphysical postulate but a concrete hypothesis about how irreversible entropy
flow modulates gravitational instability across scales.
30
Temporal Indivisibility and Memory Kernels in Lamphrodyne
Dynamics
A central claim shared by the RSVP framework and Barandes's indivisible stochastic formulation is
that the fundamental obstruction to time-local description is not spatial nonlocality but temporal
non-Markovianity.
In RSVP language, this obstruction arises because entropy redistribution is
irreversible and path-dependent: the future evolution of the plenum cannot be determined from
an instantaneous configuration alone, even in principle. This section makes that claim explicit by
19

extending the lamphrodyne fluid equations to include causal memory kernels and by showing how
such kernels generate effective quantum-like dynamics under coarse-graining.
The minimal lamphrodyne momentum equation introduced earlier assumes an instantaneous
dissipation term of the form γ(ρ)⃗v. While sufficient for identifying instability thresholds, this term
hides the essential temporal structure of entropy export. A more faithful representation replaces
instantaneous dissipation with a causal convolution,
∂t⃗v(x, t) = · · · −
∫∞
0
K(τ; ρ)⃗v(x, t −τ) dτ,
(16)
where K(τ; ρ) ≥0 is a memory kernel encoding how past coherent motion continues to dissipate
entropy into unresolved degrees of freedom. The dependence on ρ allows the strength and duration
of memory to vary across lamphrodyne regimes.
Passing to Laplace space in time, this replacement is equivalent to substituting γ(ρ) 7→bK(σ; ρ)
in the dispersion relation, where bK is the Laplace transform of K. The modified dispersion relation
therefore becomes
σ2 + bK(σ)σ +
(
k2c2
s −4πGρ0
)
+ k2αρ0
β + (Φ0/ρ0)σ
σ + λ
= 0.
(17)
The qualitative difference from the instantaneous case is immediate. Because bK(σ) is generally
nonlinear in σ, the growth or decay rate cannot be determined from a finite set of time-local
parameters. The evolution depends on the entire history encoded in the kernel.
This is precisely the sense in which the dynamics are indivisible. Attempting to evolve the
system by conditioning on an intermediate state necessarily fails unless additional hidden variables
are introduced to encode the unresolved past. Barandes's result follows directly: when one in-
sists on a time-local probabilistic description of such dynamics, one is forced to enlarge the state
space. In RSVP, this enlargement corresponds to the appearance of auxiliary interface variables—
Hilbert space amplitudes in quantum mechanics, effective metrics in cosmology, or reduced density
operators in open systems.
In low-dissipation regimes where K(τ) decays rapidly, the kernel may be approximated by its
first moment, recovering an effectively Markovian evolution and approximately unitary dynam-
ics. In strongly lamphrodyne regimes, however, long memory tails dominate, and any attempt
at time-local closure produces interference-like terms that reflect compression failure rather than
physical superposition. Temporal indivisibility is therefore not an interpretive add-on but a direct
mathematical consequence of entropy-mediated dynamics.
31
Lamphrodyne Decoherence and the Emergence of Quantum
Dynamics
The same lamphrodyne mechanism that modifies gravitational instability also provides a physical
account of quantum decoherence and the apparent emergence of Schrödinger dynamics in special
regimes. In standard quantum theory, decoherence is modeled phenomenologically by coupling a
20

system to an external bath, leading to Lindblad-type master equations. Within RSVP, decoherence
arises instead from unavoidable entropy exchange between localized structures and the surrounding
plenum, even in the absence of an explicit environment.
Consider a localized density configuration whose coarse-grained description is forced into a
reduced probabilistic representation. The underlying lamphrodyne dynamics couples this configu-
ration to entropy gradients extending beyond the localization scale. When memory effects are weak
and entropy production is suppressed, the effective evolution of the reduced description approaches
reversibility. In this limit, the Laplace-transformed kernel bK(σ) becomes approximately linear in
σ, and the dispersion relation admits oscillatory solutions with small damping. These oscillatory
modes correspond, under probability-theoretic compression, to unitary evolution in an effective
Hilbert space.
Decoherence appears when lamphrodyne memory cannot be neglected. The same kernel that
encodes indivisibility introduces additional terms in the reduced evolution equation that damp
phase coherence between compressed histories.
Unlike environmental decoherence models, this
damping is intrinsic and cannot be eliminated by improved isolation. Its magnitude depends on
the rate of entropy production and on the degree to which the system suppresses lamphrodyne flow.
This perspective reframes the preparation of near-pure quantum states. Systems such as laser-
cooled ions, superconducting qubits, or Bose-Einstein condensates correspond to regimes in which
lamphrodyne dissipation is extraordinarily small over experimental timescales. The effective purity
of these states is therefore high but never exact. RSVP predicts a fundamental lower bound on
decoherence set by residual entropy export into the plenum, independent of technological refinement.
In sufficiently sensitive experiments, this residual noise should manifest as deviations from standard
Lindblad predictions, particularly in regimes where conventional environmental couplings have been
minimized.
More broadly, the emergence of quantum field theoretic behavior can be understood as the
collective limit of many such localized lamphrodyne-suppressed regions. Field operators, vacuum
fluctuations, and particle creation events correspond to coarse-grained descriptions of entropy redis-
tribution across scales. Renormalization group flow acquires a physical interpretation as systematic
lamphrodyne coarse-graining, with ultraviolet divergences reflecting the breakdown of time-local
description at increasingly fine entropy gradients.
In this way, quantum mechanics is neither replaced nor contradicted. It is recovered as an
interface theory describing near-reversible islands embedded within an irreversible plenum. Deco-
herence marks the boundary of this approximation, and lamphrodyne dynamics supplies the missing
physical account of why that boundary exists and where it must ultimately fail.
32
A Variational Principle for Lamphrodyne Dynamics
A persistent worry for any irreversible field framework is that it may lack a principled generative
core: without an organizing variational principle, the dynamics can appear ad hoc, parameter-
driven, and unconstrained. The purpose of this section is to show that lamphrodyne dynamics
admits a natural variational formulation once one accepts a modern distinction between conservative
21

action principles and dissipative evolution principles.
In RSVP, the appropriate object is not
a single stationary-action functional but a coupled structure: a conservative sector determining
reversible transport and constraint propagation, together with a dissipation potential that generates
irreversible entropy production. This is the standard architecture of nonequilibrium variational
mechanics (Onsager-type principles and GENERIC-like formalisms), adapted to the RSVP fields.
32.1
Field content and thermodynamic potentials
Let ρ(x, t) denote a mass or energy density field, let ⃗v(x, t) denote a flow field, and let Φ(x, t) denote
an entropy-density-like field. Introduce a free-energy functional of the form
F[ρ, Φ] =
∫
Ω
(
f(ρ, Φ) + κρ
2 |∇ρ|2 + κΦ
2 |∇Φ|2)
d3x + 1
2
∫
Ω
ρ ϕg d3x,
(18)
where f(ρ, Φ) is a local free-energy density, κρ, κΦ ≥0 encode gradient penalties that represent
lamphrodyne resistance to sharp microstructure, and ϕg is the Newtonian gravitational potential
satisfying Poisson's equation. The last term in (18) is the standard gravitational self-energy written
in potential form.
The thermodynamic conjugates associated with ρ and Φ are the variational derivatives
µ := δF
δρ ,
Θ := δF
δΦ ,
(19)
interpretable, respectively, as a chemical-potential-like driving force and an entropy conjugate (a
generalized "temperature potential").
32.2
Reversible transport as constrained variational dynamics
Mass conservation is imposed as a kinematic constraint,
∂tρ + ∇· (ρ⃗v) = 0.
(20)
A minimally consistent reversible kinetic functional for the flow is
K[ρ,⃗v] =
∫
Ω
1
2ρ|⃗v|2 d3x.
(21)
In a purely conservative theory, one would combine K −F into an action and recover Euler-type
equations. RSVP does not assume such reversibility at the fundamental level. Nevertheless, the
reversible component of the motion can still be generated by a constrained variation: the advective
part of the dynamics is obtained by transporting ρ and Φ along ⃗v, while conservative forces arise
from gradients of the conjugates in (19). This identifies the geometric and gravitational terms as
originating from F rather than being imposed by hand.
22

32.3
Irreversibility from a dissipation potential
The lamphrodyne content enters through a dissipation potential, chosen so that entropy production
is nonnegative and such that weak and strong density regimes can be encoded through response
functions. A minimal Onsager-type dissipation functional is
R[ρ,⃗v, JΦ] =
∫
Ω
(1
2γ(ρ)|⃗v|2 +
1
2M(ρ)|JΦ|2
)
d3x,
(22)
where γ(ρ) ≥0 is the lamphrodyne mobility-loss coefficient discussed earlier, M(ρ) > 0 is an
entropy mobility, and JΦ is the irreversible entropy flux. The dissipation potential (22) is convex
in the fluxes, ensuring well-posedness of the variational minimization and positivity of dissipation.
The corresponding irreversible constitutive laws are obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian,
namely the instantaneous functional
Q := d
dtF[ρ, Φ] + R[ρ,⃗v, JΦ]
(23)
with respect to the fluxes (⃗v, JΦ) subject to the continuity constraints for ρ and Φ given below. The
interpretation is standard: the system selects, at each instant, the dissipative fluxes that decrease
free energy as efficiently as possible relative to the dissipation cost.
To make this explicit, impose the entropy balance in conservative form,
∂tΦ + ∇· (Φ⃗v + JΦ) = Σ,
(24)
where Σ ≥0 is an entropy production term. In the simplest lamphrodyne closure, Σ is absorbed
into the divergence of JΦ by allowing Θ to drive entropy flux down its gradient; more refined models
may separate flux and production.
Compute the free-energy dissipation rate using (20) and (24). A standard variational calculation
yields
d
dtF =
∫
Ω
(µ ∂tρ + Θ ∂tΦ) d3x =
∫
Ω
(ρ⃗v · ∇µ + (Φ⃗v + JΦ) · ∇Θ −Θ Σ) d3x,
(25)
up to boundary terms that vanish under periodic boundaries or appropriate no-flux conditions.
Substituting (25) into (23), and minimizing with respect to ⃗v and JΦ, gives the Euler-Lagrange
conditions
γ(ρ)⃗v + ρ∇µ + Φ∇Θ = 0,
1
M(ρ)JΦ + ∇Θ = 0,
(26)
so that the constitutive relations become
⃗v = −1
γ(ρ) (ρ∇µ + Φ∇Θ) ,
JΦ = −M(ρ)∇Θ.
(27)
Equations (27) are the variational core of lamphrodyne mechanics: flow arises as a gradient descent
in a generalized thermodynamic geometry, weighted by density-dependent mobility. The lamphro-
dyne asymmetry is encoded entirely in γ(ρ) and M(ρ) and is therefore mathematically explicit and
calibratable.
23

32.4
Resulting PDE system and entropy production
Substituting (27) into the balance laws yields a closed PDE system. The mass evolution becomes
∂tρ = ∇·
( ρ
γ(ρ) (ρ∇µ + Φ∇Θ)
)
,
(28)
and the entropy evolution becomes
∂tΦ = −∇· (Φ⃗v) + ∇·(M(ρ)∇Θ) + Σ.
(29)
The entropy production implied by the Rayleighian structure is nonnegative. Indeed, inserting (26)
into (23) yields
−d
dtF =
∫
Ω
(
γ(ρ)|⃗v|2 +
1
M(ρ)|JΦ|2 + Θ Σ
)
d3x ≥0,
(30)
provided γ(ρ) ≥0, M(ρ) > 0, and ΘΣ ≥0 (which holds, for example, if Σ is chosen proportional
to |∇Θ|2 or absorbed into flux as above). Thus lamphrodyne evolution is a genuine dissipative
descent of free energy, not an arbitrary dynamical rule.
32.5
Recovering the Jeans analysis within the variational framework
The Jeans-like criterion derived earlier emerges as the linearization of (28)-(29) about a uniform
background when the free-energy density f(ρ, Φ) is expanded to quadratic order and the gravita-
tional term is included through Poisson coupling. In that limit, µ and Θ become linear in (δρ, δΦ)
and the coupled descent produces exactly the renormalized sound speed and modified growth rates
obtained from the phenomenological linear model. The advantage of the variational formulation is
that it constrains which couplings are admissible, guarantees dissipation inequalities, and ties the
lamphrodyne asymmetry to explicit response functions.
32.6
Encoding the "slight" versus "extreme" crossover
The asymmetry specification problem reduces, in this formulation, to choosing γ(ρ) and M(ρ) in a
way that captures the crossover between dispersive relaxation and concentrative collapse. Because
the descent direction is determined by gradients of µ and Θ, the qualitative "flip" corresponds
to a change in mobility and entropy conduction as binding increases. A natural choice is to let
γ(ρ) depend on the dimensionless binding parameter Ξ(ρ; ℓ) defined previously, producing a sharp
crossover in mobility near the lamphrodyne Jeans threshold. This renders the distinction between
"slight" and "extreme" quantitatively meaningful: it is not a verbal classification but a statement
about where the response functions change character.
In summary, lamphrodyne mechanics admits a principled variational core. The conservative
geometry is encoded in the free-energy functional, while irreversibility and regime dependence are
encoded in convex dissipation potentials. This architecture simultaneously resolves the asymmetry
specification problem, produces a mathematically controlled stability criterion, and provides the
correct conceptual bridge to Barandes-style temporal indivisibility: the enlarged state descriptions
24

of quantum theory arise as compression interfaces for an underlying dissipative descent in the RSVP
plenum.
33
Conclusion: Indivisibility, Entropy, and the Nature of Physical
Law
The central claim developed here is that the most successful formalisms of modern physics—
quantum mechanics, spacetime geometry, and statistical descriptions of complex systems—are not
fundamental descriptions of reality, but analytical interfaces forced into existence by attempts to
compress an underlying, irreversible, and history-dependent dynamics.
Jacob Barandes's indivisible formulation of quantum theory demonstrates that the wave func-
tion is not an ontic object, but a representational artifact required when stochastic processes cannot
be temporally factorized. Linearity, superposition, and interference arise not from exotic physical
substances, but from the law of total probability applied to systems that retain memory. Quantum
mechanics, on this view, functions as an analytical mechanics for indivisible stochastic processes
rather than as a theory of fundamental states.
The RSVP framework generalizes this insight by identifying the physical source of indivisibility:
entropy production and redistribution in a continuous plenum. The universe is not composed of
expanding space punctuated by matter, nor of abstract state vectors evolving in Hilbert space. It is a
thermodynamic medium extending in all directions, whose dynamics are governed by lamphrodyne
flow—an asymmetric, irreversible smoothing of entropy gradients that preserves local structure
while exporting disorder outward.
Crucially, this dynamics admits a principled variational formulation. Lamphrodyne evolution
arises from a coupled free-energy functional and a convex dissipation potential, yielding irreversible
descent equations that respect mass conservation, gravitational coupling, and entropy production
constraints. The apparent asymmetry between dispersive relaxation and concentrative collapse is
not stipulated but encoded through density-dependent response functions in the dissipation sector.
When linearized, this variational structure reproduces a modified Jeans instability criterion, thereby
anchoring lamphrodyne mechanics to a familiar and testable threshold in gravitational physics.
Across scales, the same thermodynamic architecture recurs. In cosmology, lamphrodyne smooth-
ing produces effective separation without the creation of new space, enabling recombination, trans-
parency, and subsequent gravitational congealing. In astrophysical systems, entropy gradients drive
star formation, angular momentum accumulation, and long-lived circulatory structures. In plane-
tary environments, tidal forcing and mechanical fragmentation generate chemically rich substrates.
In chemistry and biology, autocatalytic networks emerge as attractors that stabilize their own con-
ditions of existence by redirecting entropy flow. In cognition, semantic and behavioral structures
persist by exporting informational entropy through action, communication, and environmental
modification.
At every level, complex objects are therefore not substances but processes—dissipative struc-
tures whose identities are inseparable from their histories. Attempts to describe such systems using
time-local state variables inevitably fail. To recover predictive closure, auxiliary representational
25

structures are introduced: phase space in classical mechanics, Hilbert space in quantum theory,
spacetime geometry in cosmology. These structures are indispensable for calculation, but they are
not ontic. They are compression artifacts necessitated by temporal indivisibility.
Within this framework, nonlocality is revealed as non-Markovianity in time rather than action at
a distance in space. Entanglement corresponds to shared irreversible history rather than instanta-
neous linkage. Pure states appear only as near-reversible idealizations sustained in low-dissipation
regimes. Measurement reduces to conditioning on realized configurations following entropy redis-
tribution, without invoking physical collapse. Quantization and geometric expansion emerge as
interface phenomena rather than primitive laws.
Taken together, Barandes's indivisible stochastic theory and RSVP's thermodynamic plenum
dynamics converge on a single picture: physical law is the stable residue of irreversible processes
viewed through lossy descriptive lenses.
What are traditionally called dynamics are the rules
governing these lenses, while physical objects are regions where dissipation temporarily folds back
on itself without erasing its path.
The universe does not evolve by executing equations. It evolves by redistributing entropy in
a way that cannot be undone. Equations arise because most of that history is forgotten, and the
forms they take reflect the constraints imposed by that forgetting.
