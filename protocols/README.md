# Event-Historical Frameworks: Commitment, Meaning, and Power

This repository collects a set of essays and technical documents developing a unified **event-historical framework** for understanding computation, agency, social power, and meaning.

The core claim shared across these texts is that **irreversible commitment, not mutable state**, is the fundamental unit of explanation. Systems—whether computational, social, or physical—are defined by the futures they have permanently ruled out. Meaning, agency, and power arise from histories of constraint, not from static representations or algebraic states.

Rather than treating computation as value transformation, this project treats it as **world-building**: the construction of durable, auditable histories through authorized, irreversible events.

## Core Ideas (High-Level)

Across domains, the documents develop a consistent set of principles:

- **Event-Historical Semantics**  
  Identity is defined by irreversible event histories, not by current state.

- **Commitment Over Optionality**  
  Agency is the capacity to *spend freedom* by ruling out futures through binding decisions.

- **Constraint-First Meaning**  
  Many symbolic conflicts arise when action-constraining operators are mistaken for descriptive references.

- **Structural Power (Mute Compulsion)**  
  Social order is reproduced by aligning survival with compliance, not primarily through persuasion or legitimacy.

- **Refusal as a First-Class Primitive**  
  True refusal is not preference change but structural exclusion of admissible futures.

- **Controlled Forgetting (Collapse)**  
  Abstraction is an explicit, authorized act—not an accidental loss of history.

## Unifying Thesis

> Systems become meaningful by **closing futures**, not by representing the world.

From computation to politics, worlds are built by commitment.
