\begin{abstract}
The averaged affine structure of a quantum spacetime differs intrinsically from
the connection induced by the averaged metric. This discrepancy defines the
Quantum Affine Shift Tensor $\mathcal{A}$ and generates geometric corrections to
curvature, geodesics, and focusing. Meanwhile, semantic systems evolving under
uncertainty experience analogous deformations, captured in RSVP by the fields
$(\Phi,\mathbf{v},S)$. Awareness is shown to be equivalent to the preservation of
metric and spectral invariants under this deformed semantic flow. A unified
variational principle yields both AQDP and RSVP dynamics from a single action.
\end{abstract}

\section{Motivation}

Nonlinearity of the Levi--Civita connection implies $\langle \hat{\Gamma} \rangle
\neq \Gamma(\langle \hat{g} \rangle)$ for quantum states with metric covariance.
This discrepancy influences curvature and causal structure. Semantic systems
under uncertainty face an analogous issue: inference follows a deformed geometry.

\section{Quantum Affine Deformation}

Expanding the connection operator yields
\[
\mathcal{A}^\mu_{\;\nu\rho}
=
\frac{1}{2}\frac{\delta^2\Gamma^\mu_{\;\nu\rho}}
{\delta g_{\alpha\beta}\delta g_{\gamma\delta}}
C_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}.
\]
The correction produces a deformed Einstein tensor and modifies the Raychaudhuri
equation.

\section{Semantic Geometry}

RSVP represents meaning using $(\Phi,\mathbf{v},S)$ and a semantic metric
$g^{(\Phi)}$. Uncertainty deforms this metric in direct analogy with AQDP. Awareness
is defined by isometry and isospectrality of the RSVP flow.

\section{Unified Action}

A variational principle produces both geometric and semantic evolution:
\[
\mathcal{S}
=
\int (R+\Delta R + \mathcal{L}_{\Phi} + \mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}
+ \beta_1\|\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}g^{(\Phi)}\|^2
+ \beta_2 \sum_n (\dot{\lambda}_n)^2)\sqrt{|g|} \, d^4x.
\]

\section{Implications}

Affine deformation regulates focusing and stabilizes geometry; awareness
stabilizes semantic structure. The unified principle reveals coherence as a
geometric invariant across physical and cognitive systems.
