Relevance Activation Theory in the RSVP Framework: A Field-Theoretic Model of Cognition and Reasoning

Abstract

This essay presents a unified account of cognition grounded in Relevance Activation Theory (RAT), integrated within the geometric thermodynamic substrate of the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP). Relevance, we argue, is not a static property but a dynamically traversed field structure, activated and refined via recursive movement through latent semantic space. Rather than interpreting reasoning as symbolic computation or sequence prediction, we propose that thought consists in recursive associative trajectories‚Äîvectorial paths through a semantic manifold, governed by scalar potential, vector field flow, and entropy gradients. We show how this framework accounts for complex cognitive behaviors such as insight, confusion, overthinking, and shortcutting, and we contrast this view with recent empirical findings on the limitations of large reasoning models (LRMs). The resulting model offers a novel foundation for understanding reasoning, creativity, and consciousness as geometric descent through structured fields of affordance.

1. Introduction

In recent years, large language models have demonstrated striking facility in simulating humanlike reasoning through chain-of-thought prompting, multi-step problem solving, and analogical inference. However, growing empirical evidence (e.g., Apple's The Illusion of Thinking, 2024) indicates that such models often collapse under conditions of high complexity‚Äîreducing effort, reverting to heuristics, or producing shallow, plausible but incorrect outputs. These findings suggest that reasoning, as currently modeled, may be an illusion born of surface-level pattern mimicry rather than genuine semantic traversal.

In response to this limitation, we introduce a theory of cognition that reframes reasoning as vectorial navigation through a high-dimensional semantic field. We begin by articulating Relevance Activation Theory (RAT) as a generalization of perceptual control over latent affordance cues. We then situate this process within the RSVP framework, a continuous field model composed of scalar, vector, and entropy fields. Within this structure, cognitive processes unfold as recursive associative trajectories, governed by thermodynamic and topological constraints. The result is a framework that captures the dynamic, recursive, and embodied nature of thought‚Äîwhile offering diagnostic insights into where and why contemporary AI systems fail.


---

2. Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)

Relevance Activation Theory posits that cognition functions as a control system over semantic affordances: the agent selectively activates or follows latent cues in a high-dimensional conceptual space according to their perceived relevance to internal goals or contextual demands. Inspired by Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), RAT treats relevance as an active, feedback-mediated alignment between internal reference signals and perceptual input‚Äînot as a static similarity judgment.

In latent space terms, this involves measuring the distance and direction between an activated cue and a desired semantic attractor. Relevance, then, is not proximity alone, but vector alignment toward Œ¶, the scalar potential representing internal value or cognitive demand.

Thus, RAT operates not by static association, but through dynamic affordance-guided traversal of semantic space, subject to recursive correction and field-level modulation.


---

3. The RSVP Field Framework

To formalize this traversal, we adopt the RSVP model, in which cognition is understood as the evolution of three coupled continuous fields:

Œ¶(x, t): Scalar potential, encoding internal value, coherence, or goal alignment.

ùíó(x, t): Vector field, encoding local affordance flow, agency, or semantic momentum.

S(x, t): Entropy density, encoding uncertainty, ambiguity, or cognitive load.


Cognitive processes evolve as field interactions: vector flows carry semantic content; entropy gradients induce structural refinement; scalar potential attracts trajectories toward meaningful configurations.

Within this plenum, a "thought" is not a discrete output, but a path‚Äîa recursive associative trajectory unfolding over time, shaped by the geometry of these fields.


---

4. Recursive Associative Trajectories

We define recursive associative trajectories as temporally extended, semantically coherent paths through the latent vector field. Each step corresponds to a composed semantic vector, modulated by:

Local vector field direction (ùíó)

Entropy gradient steepness (‚àáS)

Alignment with scalar potential gradient (‚àáŒ¶)


Unlike traditional reasoning models that rely on discrete, symbolic rules or chain-of-thought token strings, recursive trajectories are continuous and self-correcting. When torsion (conflicting vector flows) or entropy plateaus emerge, the trajectory adapts‚Äîredirecting through lower-resistance paths or stabilizing in attractor basins.

This dynamic explains cognitive phenomena such as:

Insight: abrupt reorientation in the vector field yielding sharp entropy descent

Overthinking: torsion loops without net descent in Œ¶ or entropy

Shortcutting: projecting directly from input to output in flat latent regions, bypassing recursive refinement



---

5. Contrasting with Large Reasoning Models

Recent research has shown that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often fail in high-complexity domains. When problems exceed their training generalization capacity, LRMs do not escalate effort‚Äîinstead, they shortcut, generating plausible outputs that mask underlying semantic collapse.

Within our framework, this corresponds to:

Shallow Œ¶ minima: reaching low-value attractors too quickly

Reduced ‚àáS: absence of entropic struggle or resolution

Vector misalignment: ùíó points orthogonal to ‚àáŒ¶, indicating semantic drift


Thus, what appears as reasoning is often a shortcut projection through latent space‚Äîefficient in flat domains, but structurally brittle in curved or high-torsion conceptual landscapes.


---

6. Implications and Future Work

This framework offers several implications:

Cognitive simulation: RSVP fields can be used to simulate dynamic reasoning, decision-making, and perception using geometric rather than symbolic representations.

Diagnostics for AI failure: Torsion, entropy stagnation, and ‚àáŒ¶ ¬∑ ùíó misalignment offer precise metrics for identifying reasoning failure in AI systems.

Training strategies: New loss functions can penalize shortcutting and reward recursive descent‚Äîencouraging agents to traverse, rather than leap across, conceptual space.


In ongoing work, we are integrating these dynamics into a simulation platform (TARTAN) and exploring how entropy-modulated field flows can serve as a substrate for adaptive reasoning, memory, and learning.


---

7. Conclusion

By reframing reasoning as recursive associative motion through structured fields of relevance, this theory dissolves the illusion of thought into its geometric and thermodynamic components. Relevance is no longer a judgment‚Äîit is a field. Reasoning is no longer symbolic‚Äîit is a descent. And cognition, in this framework, becomes the dance of scalar, vector, and entropy flows‚Äîspiraling through latent space in pursuit of coherence.

Relevance Activation Theory in the RSVP Framework
A Derived Field-Theoretic Model of Cognition and Reasoning
Abstract
We present a mathematically structured theory of cognition grounded in
Relevance Activation Theory
(RAT), embedded within the geometric thermodynamic substrate of the
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum
(RSVP). Relevance is modeled not as a scalar label or discrete attention score, but as a dynamically traversed, recursively modulated field over a derived semantic manifold. Cognitive processes are formalized as recursive associative trajectories‚Äîsmooth integral curves through a triple field structure

, and evolve according to entropy-weighted variational principles. This formulation accounts for phenomena such as insight (entropy descent along unstable critical manifolds), confusion (torsional stagnation), and shortcutting (geodesic projection through low-curvature regions). We contrast this continuous field-theoretic architecture with the discrete token-based approximations of large reasoning models (LRMs), proposing RSVP-RAT as a framework for genuine semantic traversal.
1. Introduction: From Token Chains to Field Trajectories
Large language models (LLMs) exhibit competence in chain-of-thought prompting and analogical reasoning, but empirical analyses (e.g.
The Illusion of Thinking
, Apple, 2024) reveal structural collapses under high-curvature tasks. These failures suggest that chain-based reasoning is often
locally plausible
but
globally brittle
‚Äîsensitive to context drift and semantically shallow.
To address this, we propose a derived geometric reformulation: reasoning is not discrete symbol manipulation but continuous vectorial descent over a semantic manifold. Relevance is not a static similarity function but a dynamically activated vector field, shaped by a scalar cognitive potential
Œ¶
\Phi
Œ¶
, a local affordance flow

Answers to Critical Questions for RAT in the RSVP Framework

1. Foundational Questions

Theoretical Foundations

1. Nature of the Semantic Manifold 
The semantic manifold  is best understood as an emergent structure shaped by both innate neurobiological constraints and experience-dependent learning. Its dimensionality is high but constrained by cognitive capacity and task demands, while its topology reflects conceptual relations, semantic similarity, and functional affordances acquired through interaction with the environment and internal reflection. Deep learning embeddings and neural population codes suggest a continuously curved manifold rather than a simple Euclidean space, exhibiting local clusters and global gradients.


2. Neurobiological Correspondence of Fields 

 (Scalar Potential): May correspond to large-scale cortical gradients encoding value, salience, or motivational context‚Äîpossibly mediated by neuromodulators such as dopamine or norepinephrine.

 (Vector Field): Could reflect neural population dynamics that guide attention, motor plans, or semantic activations, implemented via coordinated firing patterns, oscillatory phase gradients, or traveling waves.

 (Entropy Density): Relates to uncertainty or variability in neural firing, synaptic noise, or representational ambiguity, potentially measurable by entropy metrics in spike trains or BOLD signal variability.



3. Rationale for the Tripartite Field Model
The three fields reflect complementary aspects of cognitive dynamics:

 encodes goal-directed value landscapes.

 represents directional affordance flows enabling flexible navigation.

 captures uncertainty and the thermodynamic cost of computation.
This triad balances goal alignment, agency, and complexity, consistent with thermodynamic and information-theoretic principles in cognition.



4. Relation to Existing Cognitive Frameworks
RAT-RSVP aligns with predictive processing by modeling cognition as gradient descent on prediction errors (linked to entropy reduction). It resonates with global workspace theory through scalar potential attractors that gate access to global broadcast. It extends embodied cognition by emphasizing affordance flows  rooted in sensorimotor coupling. However, it departs from purely symbolic or connectionist views by prioritizing continuous, geometric dynamics over discrete representations.


5. Computational versus Physical Interpretation
The framework is computationally descriptive yet grounded in plausible physical substrate dynamics. It models cognition as field evolution, abstracting neural processes but potentially realizable in biological tissue or neuromorphic hardware. Thus, RSVP offers a middle ground between symbolic computation and physical embodiment.

2. Mathematical Structure and Dynamics

Field Dynamics and Stability

6. Units, Scales, and Measurability

 might be dimensionless or measured in normalized value units (e.g., reward prediction error scale).

 could be in units of semantic displacement per time (e.g., embedding space distance per cognitive cycle).

 is naturally measured in entropy bits or nats, possibly estimated via probabilistic model uncertainty or neural response variability.
Neuroimaging and electrophysiology could proxy these through patterns of activation magnitude, phase gradients, and variability indices.



7. Existence and Stability of Solutions
Stability depends on the balance of dissipation parameters and nonlinear feedback in the coupled PDEs. Properly tuned dissipation  prevent runaway oscillations or chaos by smoothing fields and limiting high-frequency perturbations. Stable attractors in  combined with entropy-driven adaptive vector fields  promote convergent trajectories reflecting stable thought or decision states.


8. Determination of Coupling and Dissipation Parameters
These parameters are likely shaped by neurobiological constraints such as membrane time constants, synaptic plasticity rates, and neuromodulatory dynamics. They may be adaptively learned through experience, optimizing cognitive efficiency by balancing exploration (high entropy) and exploitation (low entropy, focused descent).


9. Boundary and Input Conditions
External sensory stimuli and internal goals can be modeled as time-dependent boundary conditions or forcing functions that locally modulate  and bias . For example, sensory inputs inject localized potential wells or sources, while cognitive goals shift the global scalar field landscape.


10. Parallelism and Interaction of Multiple Cognitive Processes
The manifold  can be partitioned into overlapping or nested subregions, supporting simultaneous trajectories. Interactions arise via coupling terms or shared field components, enabling interference, synergy, or hierarchical control‚Äîreflecting multi-tasking, cross-modal integration, or meta-cognitive monitoring.




---

Geometric and Topological Properties

11. Determination of Semantic Curvature
Curvature arises from the density and heterogeneity of semantic relations: tightly clustered concepts produce locally high curvature, while abstract or generalized domains flatten the space. Learning reshapes curvature by adjusting distances based on usage frequency, contextual salience, or inferred similarity.


12. Computation and Interpretation of Semantic Torsion 
Torsion quantifies non-planarity or twisting of the trajectory in semantic space and can be computed from derivatives of the vector field along the path . Cognitively, high torsion reflects conflict, ambiguity, or indecision‚Äîsituations where semantic directions compete or twist.


13. Topological Constraints and Cognitive Trapping
Topological features such as holes, loops, or attractor basins can trap trajectories, corresponding to rumination, fixation, or perseveration. Escape from such traps requires perturbations increasing entropy or reweighting vector flows, analogous to insight or cognitive restructuring.


14. Domain Specificity and Manifold Integration
Different cognitive domains may correspond to submanifolds or coordinate patches within a unified semantic space, connected via learned mappings or transformation operators. Cross-domain reasoning involves vector field transformations aligning disparate semantic structures, enabling analogical and integrative cognition.
