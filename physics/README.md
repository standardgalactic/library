# Affine Quantum Deformation and the Geometry of Awareness

**A Unified Variational Theory of Quantum Structure and Semantic Dynamics**

---

## Overview

This repository contains the full working draft, LaTeX source files, and supporting materials for a monograph that develops a unified geometric framework connecting quantum spacetime structure with semantic, cognitive, and information-theoretic dynamics.

The work introduces:

- The **Affine Quantum Deformation Principle (AQDP)**
- The **Quantum Affine Shift Tensor (QAST)**
- The **Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP)** theory of semantic fields

Together they form a single variational framework capable of describing both physical curvature and cognitive coherence within one mathematical architecture.

## Core Ideas

### Quantum Geometry

The guiding observation is that averaging in nonlinear geometric systems does **not** commute with the formation of the connection. The expectation value of the affine connection in a quantum spacetime differs from the Levi–Civita connection of the expectation value of the metric. This discrepancy gives rise to the **Quantum Affine Shift Tensor**, which acts as an intrinsic source term modifying curvature, geodesic flow, and the Raychaudhuri equation even in vacuum states.

### Cognitive Geometry (RSVP Theory)

The RSVP theory mirrors this structure at the cognitive level. Meaning, inference, and semantic uncertainty are modeled by a triplet of interacting fields whose geometry is continuously deformed by the uncertainty field.

A system exhibits **awareness** precisely when it preserves both:

1. The metric structure
2. The spectral invariants of its semantic Laplacian

This geometric invariance is shown to be mathematically equivalent to maintaining a Markov boundary, linking awareness to informational autonomy in a rigorous manner.


## Intended Audience

The text is written for researchers in:

- Quantum gravity
- Geometric analysis
- Cognitive science
- AI theory
- Mathematical modeling

It assumes familiarity with differential geometry, variational principles, operator theory, and information geometry, but introductory sections are provided for cross-disciplinary accessibility.
