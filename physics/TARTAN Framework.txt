TARTAN: Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated
Noise
1.1
Introduction
The Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise (TARTAN) framework is a multi-
scale simulation and encoding paradigm designed to model the evolution of complex field sys-
tems within the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) theory. TARTAN integrates scalar (Φ),
vector (⃗⊑), and entropy (S) fields to simulate recursive, memoryful dynamics across physical,
cognitive, and cosmological domains. By leveraging recursive tiling, trajectory awareness, and
annotated noise, TARTAN encodes spatiotemporal memory and semantic coherence, enabling
the study of emergent structures and adaptive behaviors. This essay outlines TARTAN's general
principles and mathematical framework, emphasizing its role as a computational substrate for
RSVP.
1.2
General Principles
TARTAN is built on five core components that facilitate the simulation of complex, adaptive sys-
tems:
• Recursive Tiling: The simulation space is partitioned into a hierarchical grid of tiles (2D or
3D), with each tile containing sub-tiles. Higher-level tiles aggregate the dynamics of their
children, enabling multiscale resolution and coarse-grained emergent behavior.
• Trajectory Awareness: Field dynamics depend not only on current states but also on
historical configurations, including temporal derivatives, curvature, torsion, and entropic
flux. This ensures memoryful evolution and coherent flow structures.
• Annotated Noise: Perturbations are introduced as semantically tagged noise, carrying vec-
tor alignments or symbolic metadata. This enables meaningful disruptions (e.g., cognitive
intentions or physical stresses) that preserve system structure.
• Field Coupling and Cross-Tile Communication: Tiles interact via vector field coupling,
torsional fluxes, and entropy gradients, promoting coherent propagation of causal chains
across scales.
• Memory Encoding: Persistent vector alignments, entropy gradient trails, and topology-
preserving recursions enable long-term memory without external storage, supporting learn-
ing and adaptation.
TARTAN's design draws inspiration from multi-resolution analysis, perceptual control the-
ory, cellular automata, recursive semantic networks, and topological field theory. It serves as
a computational framework for RSVP, modeling phenomena such as cognitive semantic drift,
thermodynamic relaxation, or cosmological structure formation.
1.3
Mathematical Framework
TARTAN models a system as a hierarchical graph G = (V, E), where vertices V represent tiles
(field configurations) and edges E encode interactions. Each tile at level k is defined by a state
vector sk(t) = [Φk, ⃗⊑k, Sk], capturing local RSVP fields. The system evolves via a recursive update
rule:
sk(t + 1) = Tk (sk(t), sk−1(t), uk(t), nk(t)) ,
(1)
where Tk is the transformation operator for level k, sk−1(t) is the state of child tiles, uk(t) is an
external input, and nk(t) is annotated noise with semantic tags.
The transformation Tk is governed by a topological action:
STARTAN =
∑
k
∫
Mk
ωk(sk, ∇sk, nk) dµk,
(2)
1

where Mk is the manifold of tile k, ωk is a differential form encoding field interactions, and dµk
is the measure. The action is minimized subject to:
δSTARTAN = 0,
(3)
yielding equations of motion for tile states. Cross-tile communication is modeled via:
∇· (Sk⃗⊑k) =
∑
j∈neighbors
αkj(Φk −Φj) + βnk,
(4)
where αkj governs field coupling, and β weights annotated noise. Memory is encoded through
persistent terms:
mk(t) = γ
∫t
0
⃗⊑k(τ) · ∇Sk(τ) dτ,
(5)
where mk(t) is the memory vector, and γ is a persistence factor.
1.4
Implications and Applications
TARTAN's recursive, trajectory-aware structure makes it a versatile tool for modeling complex
systems. In cognitive modeling, it simulates recursive thought and semantic drift, with anno-
tated noise representing intentions or surprises. In RSVP cosmology, TARTAN models entropic
relaxation and spacetime emergence, with tiles representing coarse-grained field configurations.
In AI, it enables field-like reasoning systems with symbolic perturbations. In materials science,
TARTAN can simulate adaptive systems, where recursive tiling mirrors lattice dynamics, and
annotated noise models external stresses. Visual simulations benefit from TARTAN's ability to
drive self-organizing field dynamics with meaningful perturbations.
The framework's emphasis on memory and coherence supports applications in conscious-
ness modeling, where persistent field invariants may encode qualia. Future work may involve
numerical implementations of TARTAN to simulate specific systems, such as cosmological struc-
ture formation or neural learning, leveraging its multiscale and recursive nature.
1.5
Conclusion
TARTAN provides a powerful computational substrate for RSVP theory, enabling the simulation
of recursive, memoryful, and semantically coherent dynamics. Its mathematical framework,
rooted in hierarchical tiling, trajectory awareness, and annotated noise, captures the interplay of
RSVP fields across scales. By modeling adaptive systems as interwoven field trajectories, TARTAN
offers a path toward unifying physical, cognitive, and cosmological phenomena under a single
computational paradigm.
