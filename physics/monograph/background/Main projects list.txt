Here's a structured list of your
main ongoing projects and frameworks
, grouped by their conceptual domains. Each entry includes its focus and interrelations so you can use it for indexing, summaries, or resumes.
I. Core Theoretical Frameworks
Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP)
Unified cosmological-cognitive field theory describing reality through scalar (Œ¶), vector (ùíó), and entropy (S) fields.
Themes: non-expanding universe, entropic gravity, lamphron-lamphrodyne dynamics, entropy descent, and consciousness as field geometry.
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise)
Multiscale simulation framework for RSVP lattice models.
Implements recursive tiling, Gaussian aura fields, and annotated noise for trajectory-dependent, interpretable scene generation.
HYDRA (Hybrid Dynamic Reasoning Architecture)
Cognitive architecture integrating PERSCEN, Relevance Activation Theory (RAT), Chain of Memory (CoM), and RSVP/TARTAN semantics for interpretable AI cognition.
CLIO (Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization)
Recursive inference functor derived from RSVP, formalizing self-modifying cognitive feedback loops and active inference.
Simulated Agency: Consciousness as a Sparse Projection Engine
Grand synthesis linking RSVP, CLIO, and TARTAN through sparse Bayesian inference and feedback coherence; formalized via category and variational geometry.
UFTC-SF (Unified Field Theory of Coherence ‚Äî Super-Field Formulation)
Extension of Roy Logan's coherence model, reformulated in RSVP terms using scalar-vector-entropy coupling and categorical field theory.
Semantic Infrastructure: Entropy-Respecting Computation in a Modular Universe
A post-Git system for semantic versioning based on sheaf theory, symmetric monoidal ‚àû-categories, and entropy flow mappings into RSVP fields.
Chain of Memory (CoM)
Framework for causally faithful latent memory trajectories and recursive inference, often integrated with TARTAN and HYDRA.
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)
Model of cue-driven, gradient-based cognition embedded within RSVP semantics.
Viviception / Entropic Tropism of Mind
RSVP-based theory of consciousness as entropic gradient-following (movement-toward), integrating phenomenology, Caticha's entropic dynamics, and embodied tropism.
II. Simulation and Software Systems
RSVP Field Simulator
GPU-accelerated 3D lattice system modeling coupled Œ¶-ùíó-S fields; visualizes entropic smoothing, torsion, and lamphron-lamphrodyne effects.
RSVP-AI Prototype
Semantic computational substrate for agent cognition, implementing entropy-aware field dynamics and CLIO feedback.
Yarncrawler Framework
Integrates semantic graph traversal, Chain of Memory principles, and entropy flow tracking across recursive cognitive networks.
Operator Ecology Playground
Experimental interface for testing operator compositions, entropy minimization, and field coupling dynamics.
EssayForge / Yarnwinder
Recursive academic writing system using entropy-coherence scoring, parallel section generation, and BibTeX/XeLaTeX integration.
III. Cosmology and Physics Extensions
The Fall of Space: Entropic Relaxation and Structure Without Expansion
Foundational RSVP cosmology paper proposing that apparent expansion is entropic smoothing, not metric inflation.
Gravity as Entropy Descent
Comparative essay contrasting RSVP with Jacobson, Verlinde, and Carney's entropic gravity theories.
Unistochastic Quantum Theory as an Emergent Description of RSVP
Formal mapping between Barandes's unistochastic quantum mechanics and RSVP's continuous field ontology.
IV. Applied and Experimental Systems
Entropy Ledger / Recursive Futarchy
Economic-governance framework using entropic accounting and negentropic coupling to replace monetary abstraction.
Hepastitium Project (Relativistic Theory of Longevity)
Bioengineering initiative modeling cellular coherence and tissue regeneration via RSVP-like field stabilization.
Xylomorphic Architecture
Biourban design paradigm modeling cities and organs on forest feedback networks and pulp-based intelligence.
Vanity Press Economy
Critical essay on tokenized content and advertising as AI's "original sin," exploring misalignment economics.
Deccelerationist Agenda
Philosophical framework advocating entropy-aware governance, opposing accelerationist techno-fetishism.
V. Artistic and Narrative Extensions
Entropy's Edge
4X strategy and narrative simulation illustrating RSVP dynamics via civilization-scale entropy management.
Blastoids
Retro vector-graphics 3D shooter demonstrating RSVP field visualization through gameplay.
The Surface / Eloi vs. Morlocks Storyline
Fictional explorations of RSVP cosmology and entropic ethics, blending field theory with mythic allegory.
Zero Day Exploits Essay Cycle
Philosophical and mathematical essays extending RSVP through algebraic, categorical, and sheaf-theoretic directions.
VI. Educational and Organizational Work
RSVP Study Guide & Course Framework
Structured educational program with quizzes, glossaries, and formal introductions to RSVP's mathematics and philosophy.
Project Flyxion Repository Network
Massive interlinked corpus (22,000+ GitHub repos) coordinating RSVP, HYDRA, and related systems with JSON/HDF5 field interchange.
Atlas Indexer / Semantic Merge Library
Toolchain for managing inter-document semantic relations and merge operations across your theoretical corpus.
