Negative Utilitronium: Rest Economy Proposal

This is a highly theoretical and provocative paper proposing a radical rethinking of economics based on the principle of "Negative Utilitronium." Here's a summary and analysis of its core ideas:
Core Concept: Negative Utilitronium
The paper argues that modern economies are trapped in a destructive cycle of perpetual growth, measured by GDP and consumption, which leads to ecological overshoot, inflation, and human exhaustion. The proposed solution is an inversion of this paradigm:
maximizing societal well-being by minimizing economic activity and energy expenditure.
The name "Negative Utilitronium" plays on:
Utility:
The foundation of classical economics (maximizing pleasure/satisfaction).
Utilitronium:
A transhumanist concept of a universe optimized for maximum happiness.
Negative:
Here, it signifies the inversion—maximum utility is achieved through minimal activity, or "stillness."
Proposed Mechanism: Spatial Subsistence Allocation (SSA)
This is the paper's version of a Universal Basic Income (UBI), but with a crucial twist:
payment is tied explicitly to immobility.
Tiered Payments:
$200
for being home-bound.
$100
for staying within a 1 km radius.
$50
for staying within a 100 km radius.
The goal is to financially incentivize reduced movement, which the paper frames as the primary source of economic "entropy" (disorder, waste, inflation).
Theoretical Foundations
The paper draws from several advanced fields to build its case:
Thermodynamics & Ecology:
It treats the economy as a thermodynamic system, where economic activity (motion, production) increases entropy (waste, inflation). The SSA is a mechanism to promote "negentropy" (order, stability).
Cybernetics & Information Theory:
It likens wasteful economic activity to irreversible computation that dissipates energy. "Stillness" is the economic equivalent of reversible computation, preserving value without waste.
Degrowth & Post-Work Economics:
It operationalizes degrowth principles by making "self-limitation" and "restraint" the basis for income, moving beyond critiques of "bullshit jobs" to a concrete fiscal model.
Complex Mathematics (RSVP, Category/Sheaf Theory):
The paper uses sophisticated mathematical frameworks (Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum, Category Theory, Sheaf Theory) to model the economy as a field where fiscal policy, entropy, and mobility interact. It derives equations for a "fiscal wave equation" and "fiscal entropy elasticity" to show how compensated stillness leads to a stable, low-entropy equilibrium.
Key Policy Proposals
SSA System:
As described above.
Mandatory Recycling:
Enforced, universal recycling to create "negentropic cycles," turning waste into a resource. Non-compliance would incur "entropy penalties."
Implementation Architecture:
Verification:
Privacy-preserving geofencing using zero-knowledge proofs to verify location without surveillance.
Payment:
Via a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) with smart contracts that automate SSA payments.
Governance:
Public "entropy-accounting oracles" to transparently track the national level of economic "motion."
Predicted Outcomes
The paper's "toy model" simulations predict dramatic results:
Energy consumption ↓ 40%
Inflation volatility ↓ 60%
Net carbon emissions approach 2030 targets within 18 months
While GDP falls by 20%, a proposed "Effective Well-Being Index" rises by 15%.
Philosophical Implications
The paper makes a profound philosophical shift:
Pleasure as Rest:
The ultimate good is redefined from active pleasure to "hedonic calm" and "the pleasure of zero-differential."
The State as a Dampener:
The role of government transforms from stimulating growth to stabilizing the system and reducing "noise."
Cognitive Parallel:
It draws a direct analogy to Karl Friston's "Free-Energy Principle" in neuroscience, suggesting the brain also seeks to minimize entropy, and this economic model externalizes that principle to society.
Critiques and Counterarguments (Addressed by the Paper)
The paper preemptively addresses obvious criticisms:
Surveillance Risk:
Mitigated by using advanced cryptography (zero-knowledge proofs).
Economic Stagnation:
Re-framed as a transition to "knowledge-based, asynchronous creative work."
Social Isolation:
Addressed by funding "virtual commons" with the SSA dividends.
Moral Hazard ("pretend stillness"):
Addressed with randomized audits and algorithmic anomaly detection.
Conclusion
"Negative Utilitronium" is a deeply theoretical, ambitious, and radical thought experiment. It challenges the most fundamental assumptions of economics—that activity and growth are inherently good. By framing stillness as a valuable, compensable state and using advanced scientific and mathematical concepts to model its benefits, the paper proposes a path toward a "Rest Economy" characterized by thermodynamic coherence, ecological sustainability, and a redefined concept of human well-being. Whether feasible or desirable, it serves as a powerful critique of the status quo and a bold vision for a post-growth future.
