Here's a current consolidated list of your
main projects
, drawing on the full RSVP ecosystem and your recent conversations:
üßÆ Core Theoretical Frameworks
RSVP (Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum)
‚Äî The central unifying field theory redefining cosmology as entropic smoothing rather than spatial expansion.
RSVP Field Simulator
‚Äî Numerical PDE simulator for Œ¶ (scalar entropy), ùíó (vector flow), and S (entropy) fields with adaptive mesh and GPU acceleration.
Derived AKSZ/BV RSVP Sigma Model
‚Äî Formal quantization of RSVP fields using derived stacks, shifted symplectic structures, and BV differentials.
RSVP-CLIO Bridge
‚Äî Integration of reinforcement learning (GRPO/PPO) into continuous RSVP dynamics for cognitive field modeling.
Negative Utilitronium
‚Äî Economic theory of "compensated stillness" linking entropy, expenditure, and minimal action economies.
Thermodynamic Governance / Recursive Futarchy
‚Äî Entropy-aware model of governance and policy as thermodynamic regulation.
Ethical Cotangent Fields
‚Äî Moral formalism of RSVP gradients and BV cotangent structures as ethical flow dynamics.
üß† Cognitive & AI Architectures
CLIO (Cognitive Loop via In-Situ Optimization)
‚Äî Recursive inference framework modeled as a thermodynamic field loop.
HYDRA (Hybrid Dynamic Reasoning Architecture)
‚Äî Integrative reasoning system merging RSVP, RAT, and CoM.
RAT (Relevance Activation Theory)
‚Äî Theory of cognitive coherence and activation paths in RSVP field space.
CoM (Chain-of-Memory)
‚Äî Temporal coherence operator modeling persistence and recall in dynamic systems.
Simulated Agency / Simulated Danger
‚Äî Developmental and ontogenetic theory of fear and intelligence as entropy navigation.
üåå Cosmology & Physics
Entropic Redshift Integrator
‚Äî Numerical model for cosmic entropy smoothing and redshift reinterpretation.
Expyrosis Cycle
‚Äî RSVP's end-state cosmological model: crystalline freeze and recursive re-ignition.
Unistochastic Continuum / Indivisible Quantum Mechanics
‚Äî Bridge between Barandes's ISQM and RSVP entropic continuum.
üß© Mathematical Infrastructure
Derived L-System Sigma Models
‚Äî Integration of L-systems, derived stacks, and BV quantization.
TARTAN (Trajectory-Aware Recursive Tiling with Annotated Noise)
‚Äî Recursive tiling algebra encoding entropy flow and semantic geometry.
Spherepop Calculus
‚Äî Probabilistic, bubble-based programming language for RSVP/TARTAN operations.
Operator Ecology
‚Äî Unification of lamphron, lamphrodyne, and amplitwist operators across physics, cognition, and semantics.
üß¨ Consciousness & Information Geometry
RSVP Field of Consciousness
‚Äî Modeling subjective awareness as scalar-vector-entropy field coupling.
œÜ_RSVP Metric
‚Äî Entropy-based consciousness measure derived from RSVP's field coherence.
Semantic Infrastructure Project
‚Äî Framework for distributed reasoning and cognitive coherence across agents.
üèóÔ∏è Design, Simulation & Media
Entropy's Edge: The RSVP Wars
‚Äî 4X-style strategy game integrating entropic smoothing mechanics, Expyrosis cycles, and lamphron turns.
Yarncrawler
‚Äî Recursive infrastructure repair vehicle and metaphor for self-coherent cognition.
Spherepop 3D Objects
‚Äî Sculptural / CAD representations of RSVP-derived geometries.
Hallucinated Soundscapes
‚Äî Adaptive generative audio/film concept linked to RSVP semantic dynamics.
Entropy and Utopia / Operator Ecology Essays
‚Äî Philosophical-literary works tying RSVP to art, politics, and ethics.
üìö Major Publication & Corpus Projects
Zero Day Exploits Corpus
‚Äî 7-cycle, 42-book meta-series covering RSVP cosmology, cognition, and civilization.
Gravity as Entropy Descent
‚Äî Scholarly commentary comparing RSVP with emergent gravity theories.
Curvature, Entropy, and Governance
‚Äî Formal treatise linking RSVP theory to thermodynamic civilization.
Would you like me to expand this into a
tiered roadmap
(e.g.,
Active / Canonical / Dormant
) or a
visual dependency map
showing which frameworks feed into which others (RSVP ‚Üí CLIO ‚Üí HYDRA, etc.)?
