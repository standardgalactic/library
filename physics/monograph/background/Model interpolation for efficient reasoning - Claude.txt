I'll analyze this paper on model interpolation for efficient reasoning and help you understand its key contributions.
Paper Overview
This paper systematically studies
model interpolation
- a simple method of merging "Instruct" models (optimized for short, direct answers) with "Thinking" models (specialized in long chain-of-thought reasoning) to achieve efficient reasoning in Large Language Models.
Key Findings
1.
Three-Stage Evolutionary Paradigm
The authors discovered that as the interpolation coefficient Î» increases from 0 to 1, the merged model follows three distinct stages:
Stage #1 (Î» âˆˆ [0, 0.4))
: Dominated by Instruct model
Responses get longer but without explicit reasoning
Pass@k increases, but Mean@k improves slowly
Almost no
</think>
tokens appear
Stage #2 (Î» âˆˆ [0.4, 0.6])
: Critical transition phase
Explicit thinking patterns rapidly emerge
Mean@k increases dramatically while Pass@k remains stable
"Sweet spot" for efficiency-effectiveness trade-off
Stage #3 (Î» âˆˆ (0.6, 1.0])
: Convergence to Thinking model
Much longer outputs with full reasoning
Diminishing returns on performance
Evidence of "over-thinking" phenomenon
2.
Superior Performance
Model interpolation (MI) outperforms sophisticated baselines including:
Task Arithmetic (TA)
TIES-Merging
Other model merging methods
On challenging benchmarks (AIME'25, IFEval, GPQA-Diamond), strategically interpolated models achieve better accuracy with fewer tokens.
3.
Mechanistic Insights
Through ablation studies, they found:
Layer-wise
: Reasoning capabilities are concentrated in the middle and later layers (last 2/3 of model)
Module-wise
:
FFN layers control
whether
the model uses step-by-step reasoning
Attention layers control the
quality
of reasoning
Robustness
: Interpolated models are stable across different decoding strategies
Practical Implications
Token Budget Control
: By selecting appropriate Î», you can precisely control the trade-off between reasoning depth and computational cost
Training-Free
: No additional training required - just weighted averaging of parameters
Scalable
: The three-stage paradigm holds across different model sizes (4B and 30B parameters)
Mathematical Formulation
The interpolation is simply:
Î˜(Merge) = Î»Î˜(Thinking) + (1-Î»)Î˜(Instruct)
The authors show this is equivalent to Task Arithmetic with the base model canceled out.
Limitations
Primarily validated on Qwen3 models (need verification on other families)
Limited to two-model interpolation (extending to 3+ models is future work)
Bottom Line
This paper demonstrates that the simplest merging approach - direct weight interpolation - can be highly effective when done strategically. The three-stage framework provides a principled guide for practitioners to create models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities without additional training costs.

Main Points
1.
Core Problem
Long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs causes high latency and "over-thinking"
Need to balance reasoning capability with token efficiency
2.
Proposed Solution: Model Interpolation (MI)
Merge Thinking model (long CoT) with Instruct model (short answers)
Formula:
Î˜(Merge) = Î»Î˜(Thinking) + (1-Î»)Î˜(Instruct)
Training-free and agnostic to base model

Experimental Results
Models tested:

Benchmarks:
AIME'25 (math), IFEval (instruction-following), GPQA-Diamond (science)
Key finding:
MI-0.8 consistently outperforms sophisticated baselines (Task Arithmetic, TIES-Merging)

IFEval:
Uses ~50% fewer tokens than baselines with better accuracy
Controllability:
Smooth progression of thinking ratio (Think #R) from 0% to 100%
6.
Mechanistic Insights (Ablation Studies)
Layer-wise:
Last 2/3 of model layers are critical for reasoning
First 1/3 alone cannot induce thinking behavior
Module-wise:
FFN layers:
Control thinking pattern emergence (when to think)
Attention layers:
Control reasoning quality (how to think correctly)
Decoding Strategy:
Performance is robust across temperature and Top-p variations
7.
Practical Guidelines
For efficiency-focused tasks: Use Î» â‰ˆ 0.4-0.6 (Stage #2)
For maximum performance: Use Î» â‰ˆ 0.8
Larger models may require higher Î» for optimal performance
8.
Theoretical Contribution
MI is equivalent to Task Arithmetic without requiring the base model
Provides principled framework for navigating performance-cost trade-offs
9.
Limitations
Primarily validated on Qwen3 family (needs testing on Llama, Mistral, etc.)
Limited to two-model interpolation
Stage boundaries vary by model size
10.
Main Contributions (Authors' Summary)
Discovered and characterized the three-stage evolutionary paradigm
Demonstrated MI surpasses sophisticated baselines empirically
Provided deep mechanistic insights through fine-grained ablations
Key Takeaway:
Simple direct weight interpolation, when done strategically using the three-stage framework, can outperform complex merging methods for creating efficient reasoning models without any additional training.
