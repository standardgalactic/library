Recommendations for Improving Rigor and Clarity
Critical Structural Issues
1.
Establish Mathematical Foundations First
Problem
: The paper jumps into advanced constructions (AKSZ, BV-BRST, derived stacks) without establishing basic well-definedness
Fix
: Add a preliminary section proving:
Existence and uniqueness theorems for RSVP field equations
Conditions under which solutions exist (functional spaces, boundary conditions)
Well-posedness of the initial value problem
Regularity requirements for the fields (Œ¶, v, S)
2.
Rigorously Define the Functor C‚ÇÅ
Problem
: The coarse-graining functor is described informally; the inverse functor R‚ÇÅ is only mentioned
Fix
:
Prove C‚ÇÅ is actually a functor (preserves composition and identities)
Specify the categorical morphisms explicitly
Prove the claimed homotopy-adjunction with explicit unit/counit maps
Show under what conditions the reconstruction R‚ÇÅ is well-defined
Address non-uniqueness: many RSVP fields could yield the same Œì
3.
The Unitary Embedding Needs Justification
Problem
: Section 12 claims v = ‚àáŒ∏ implies Œì·µ¢‚±º = |U·µ¢‚±º|¬≤ with U = e^(iŒ∏/‚Ñè), but this is insufficiently justified
Fix
:
Prove when a doubly-stochastic matrix admits unitary factorization (cite Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem limitations)
Show explicitly how phases Œ∏ on cell boundaries yield consistent unitary matrices
Address the non-uniqueness of phase choices (gauge freedom)
Prove double-stochasticity from your flux formula actually guarantees unistochasticity
Technical Mathematical Issues
4.
Detailed Balance and Reversibility
Problem
: Section 11 claims detailed balance "for reversible flows" without definition
Fix
:
Define precisely what "reversible flow" means in RSVP context
Prove detailed balance: Œì·µ¢‚±ºœÅ‚±º^eq = Œì‚±º·µ¢œÅ·µ¢^eq
Specify conditions on œÉ(S) and f(Œ¶) for reversibility
Your current œÉ(S) = -Œ∫S¬≤ breaks time-reversal symmetry‚Äîaddress this
5.
The AKSZ Construction Needs Verification
Problem
: AKSZ constructions require specific geometric conditions that aren't verified
Fix
:
Verify X = T*[0]X is actually the target (what is the base space X?)
Prove Œò is Hamiltonian: {Œò,Œò} = 0 explicitly using your fields
Show the action is actually Q-exact: S = {Q, Œ®} for some Œ®
Verify grading consistency throughout
6.
BV Master Equation
Problem
: You claim (S_BV, S_BV) = 0 "holds due to closed algebras and AKSZ integrability" without proof
Fix
:
Compute the antibracket (S_BV, S_BV) explicitly term-by-term
Show all contributions cancel
Verify ghost number conservation
Check consistency with equations of motion
7.
The Path Integral Discretization
Problem
: Section C.3 makes a huge leap from continuous path integral to discrete sum
Fix
:
Provide rigorous lattice regularization
Prove the continuum limit exists
Show how the Faddeev-Popov determinant contributes
Justify the claimed form of Œì·µ¢‚±º from the discretized action
8.
Semiclassical Expansion
Problem
: One-loop determinants and anomalies are stated without calculation
Fix
:
Show the fluctuation operator K_AB explicitly
Compute the functional determinant using standard methods (Œ∂-function regularization)
Derive the anomaly coefficients Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ±‚ÇÇ, Œ±‚ÇÉ from explicit loop calculations
Prove the curvature terms appear at one-loop order
9.
RG Flow Beta Functions
Problem
: Beta functions are given without derivation
Fix
:
Show the loop calculations leading to each beta function
Prove the fixed points are actually fixed: Œ≤(D*) = 0
Analyze stability of fixed points (compute anomalous dimensions)
Show the flow equations are consistent with the master equation
Conceptual Clarity Issues
10.
The "Indivisibility" Concept
Problem
: Used throughout but never precisely defined mathematically
Fix
:
Give a formal definition distinguishing "indivisible" from standard non-Markovian processes
Specify what mathematical structure enforces indivisibility
Clarify relationship to quantum measurement's indivisibility
11.
Entropy Production Term œÉ(S)
Problem
: Introduced ad hoc as œÉ(S) = -Œ∫S¬≤
Fix
:
Justify this functional form from microscopic considerations
Prove it yields positive entropy production: ‚à´œÉ(S)d¬≥x ‚â• 0
Derive from coarse-graining or fluctuation theorems
Show consistency with second law
12.
Thermodynamic Consistency
Problem
: Claims thermodynamic consistency but doesn't prove it
Fix
:
Define entropy S_tot[Œ¶,S] for the whole system
Prove dS_tot/dt ‚â• 0 along RSVP flow
Show connection to relative entropy or free energy
Verify entropy balance equation is satisfied
13.
Comparison with ISQM
Problem
: The paper asserts RSVP coarse-grains to ISQM but doesn't demonstrate equivalence
Fix
:
Take a specific ISQM example from Barandes's work
Explicitly construct the RSVP field configuration that reproduces it
Show the Born rule emerges with proper normalizations
Verify interference and entanglement are correctly captured
14.
The "Worked Example" Isn't Worked
Problem
: Section 14 gives a 2√ó2 matrix without showing it's unistochastic
Fix
:
Actually find the unitary U such that Œì = |U|¬≤
Show all eigenvalues satisfy unistochastic constraints
Demonstrate interference effects in this simple system
Extend to a non-trivial example (3-state minimum)
Presentation and Rigor
15.
Distinguish Conjectures from Theorems
Problem
: Many claims are stated as facts but are actually conjectures or require proof
Fix
:
Label propositions, theorems, lemmas, conjectures explicitly
Mark speculative sections clearly
Add rigorous proofs or cite relevant theorems
Be explicit about what is established vs. proposed
16.
Specify All Assumptions
Problem
: Many hidden assumptions (regularity, boundary conditions, measure theory)
Fix
:
State functional spaces for all fields (Sobolev spaces, etc.)
Specify boundary conditions on Œ£
Define measures for path integrals rigorously
State when ‚Ñè ‚Üí 0 limits are valid
17.
The Categorical Framework
Problem
: Appendices G-H introduce heavy categorical machinery that may be overkill
Fix
(choose one approach):
Either: Develop categorical structure rigorously with all coherence conditions
Or: Remove categorical language and state results in standard mathematical physics terms
If keeping: prove all claimed adjunctions, natural transformations, and homotopy commutativity
18.
Physical Predictions
Problem
: No testable predictions distinguish this from standard QM
Fix
:
Identify observable consequences of the RSVP field
Propose experiments where RSVP differs from Copenhagen/Bohm/GRW
Compute corrections to known QM results
Address how to measure (Œ¶, v, S) operationally
19.
Connection to Bohmian Mechanics
Problem
: Claims to avoid non-locality but doesn't prove this rigorously
Fix
:
Show explicitly that Bell inequality violations are reproduced
Prove no superluminal signaling
Clarify whether correlations in Œì·µ¢‚±º are local or non-local
Address how entanglement emerges without non-local connections
20.
Notation and Consistency
Problem
: Inconsistent notation (sometimes Œ® for fields, sometimes for superfield)
Fix
:
Create a comprehensive notation table
Use consistent symbols throughout
Distinguish classical fields, quantum operators, and derived objects
Clarify when summation convention is used
Major Mathematical Gaps to Address
Priority 1: Prove the central claim
Theorem (to prove)
: "For any unistochastic matrix Œì arising from ISQM, there exists an RSVP field configuration (Œ¶, v, S) such that C‚ÇÅ(Œ¶,v,S) = Œì, and vice versa (modulo equivalence)."
Priority 2: Establish well-posedness
Prove existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on initial data for the RSVP equations.
Priority 3: Derive, don't assert
Every beta function, anomaly coefficient, and emergent structure should have a clear derivation or proof sketch.
Recommended Additional Content
Explicit examples section
: Work through double-slit, EPR, etc. in full detail
Comparison table
: ISQM vs. RSVP vs. Bohm vs. Copenhagen with specific predictions
Numerical methods section
: How to actually simulate RSVP dynamics
Glossary
: Define all technical terms from derived geometry, BV formalism, etc.
This framework has interesting ideas but needs substantial mathematical rigor before it can be considered a well-founded theory. Focus on proving your central claims with the same rigor expected in mathematical physics literature.
