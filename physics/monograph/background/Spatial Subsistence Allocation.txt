A kind of theoretical policy to minimize waste and expenditure. The government pays everyone 200$ a day to stay in their homes, 100$ to stay within one kilometer, and 50$ for staying within one hundred kilometers. A basic income to minimize cost spiraling
ChatGPT said:
That's a fascinating thought experiment — a
negative-mobility
universal basic income (UBI) designed to curb both economic and environmental externalities by
incentivizing stillness
. Here's how we might formalize it into a
theoretical policy framework
you could call something like
"Spatial Subsistence Allocation" (SSA)
or
"Inertial Dividend Policy" (IDP)
.
1. Concept Overview: "Paying for Inaction"
Premise:
Traditional economic systems incentivize activity—production, consumption, movement—which indirectly drives cost spiraling through energy expenditure, infrastructure wear, and resource depletion.
The
SSA/IDP model
reverses this: it
pays for non-activity within bounded radii
to internalize the costs of externalities.
Core policy rule:
$200/day for remaining at home.
$100/day for remaining within 1 km.
$50/day for remaining within 100 km.
These payments represent an
inverse mobility index
—a
negentropic wage
for reducing energy throughput in the national economy.
2. Theoretical Justification
a. Entropic-Economic Rationale
Each act of movement and exchange increases systemic entropy—materially (fuel, food, wear) and informationally (transactions, logistics).
Minimizing motion stabilizes the macrostate and reduces systemic entropy production.

(individual mobility) directly lowers the global entropy rate.
b. Keynesian Stabilization Inversion
Instead of stimulating demand to raise GDP, SSA stimulates
stability
to minimize inflationary pressures and resource depletion.
It functions as a
Keynesian anti-stimulus
: a liquidity provision that slows rather than accelerates economic flow.
c. Degrowth Economics
By subsidizing stillness, the state deliberately
shrinks kinetic GDP
while preserving welfare.
Output decreases, but
utility per energy unit
increases, aligning with degrowth principles and post-scarcity ethics.

Funding is drawn from:
Reduced transportation subsidies and fuel tax offsets.
Decommissioned military and infrastructure expansion budgets.
Climate mitigation savings.
4. Economic and Social Effects
a. Inflation Dampening
Reduced demand for goods/services outside the home counteracts price pressures in logistics and manufacturing.
b. Cost Containment
Infrastructure decay, maintenance, and energy consumption fall sharply.
Healthcare costs decrease via fewer accidents and emissions.
c. Labor and Productivity Transformation
Work shifts toward remote or
asynchronous
models; creative, educational, and digital economies expand.
SSA effectively decouples income from production velocity.
5. Variants and Extensions
Entropy Tax Credit:
Businesses can receive rebates proportional to employee immobility or digital operation ratios.
Collective Inertia Bonus:
Neighborhoods with aggregated low-mobility averages earn shared infrastructure grants.
Dynamic Scaling:
Payments fluctuate with national energy load—higher during crises, lower in surpluses.
6. Critiques and Responses
Critique
Response
"It discourages work."
Yes, intentionally—shifts work toward meaning rather than throughput.
"It's surveillance-heavy."
Privacy-preserving proofs (zero-knowledge geolocation attestations) can verify compliance.
"It collapses GDP."
GDP declines, but
effective well-being
and
ecological sustainability
rise.
"It's regressive."
Progressive supplements can weight payments by income percentile or energy consumption footprint.
7. Broader Interpretation
Viewed through the RSVP theoretical lens, this is a
macroeconomic entropy-minimization mechanism
—a form of
societal lamphrodyne
that smooths energetic gradients in the social field.
Citizens become
stationary nodes of coherence
, reducing systemic turbulence through compensated stillness.
Would you like me to extend this into a
formal policy white paper draft
—including modeled equations for expenditure equilibrium and a section on implementation logistics (e.g., blockchain disbursement, entropy accounting, or telemetric validation)?
You said:
Yeah, call the paper Negative Utilitronium and make it much longer with more literature review and mathematical formalization.

Excellent — to build
"Negative Utilitronium: Toward an Economics of Compensated Stillness"

Negative Utilitronium: Toward an Economics of Compensated Stillness
Abstract
This paper develops the concept of
Negative Utilitronium
, a theoretical economic state in which maximal well-being arises from minimal physical and informational activity. We propose a
Spatial Subsistence Allocation
(SSA) system where immobility is financially incentivized: individuals receive tiered payments proportional to their confinement radius ($200 for home-bound, $100 within 1 km, $50 within 100 km). Framed within thermodynamic, cybernetic, and degrowth literatures, this model treats expenditure and entropy as conjugate variables. Through differential formalization and simulation, we show how compensated stillness minimizes cost spiraling, stabilizes inflation, and converges toward a steady-state negentropic economy. Negative Utilitronium is not an abolition of utility but its inversion: pleasure as rest, agency as restraint, and motion as externality.
1. Introduction: From Growth to Stillness
Modern economies remain tethered to the ideology of perpetual motion—measured through GDP, consumption velocity, and supply-chain throughput. Yet, empirical crises - ecological overshoot, inflationary bubbles, and psychosocial exhaustion - suggest that activity itself has become the principal cost center.
This study inverts the growth paradigm. Instead of stimulating motion through fiscal expansion, we propose
paying for stillness
. The concept of Negative Utilitronium describes an asymptotic limit where societal utility is maximized when total systemic energy expenditure approaches a minimum, constrained by cognitive and physiological sustenance.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Thermodynamic and Ecological Foundations
Georgescu-Roegen (1971)
-
The Entropy Law and the Economic Process
introduced the entropic framing of economics.
Daly (1996)
- Steady-state economics: maintaining throughput within ecological carrying capacity.
Odum & Odum (2001)
-
The Prosperous Way Down
, emphasizing descent as optimization rather than collapse.
Ayres & Warr (2009)
- Identified exergy as the true driver of GDP, linking energy flow to output.
Negative Utilitronium extends this lineage by introducing
state-compensated negentropy
—a direct monetary coupling to entropy reduction.
2.2 Cybernetics and Information Theory
Wiener (1948)
- Entropy as uncertainty; control as negative entropy.
Landauer (1961)
- Information erasure has thermodynamic cost.
Bennett (1982)
- Reversible computation minimizes dissipation.
Economic activity can be reinterpreted as
information erasure
; stillness becomes reversible computation—an asymptotic reduction of wasted information.
2.3 Degrowth and Post-Work Economies
Kallis (2018)
- Degrowth as ethical self-limitation.
Graeber (2018)
-
Bullshit Jobs
critiques purposeless labor proliferation.
Srnicek & Williams (2015)
- Fully Automated Luxury Communism suggests automation decouples income from work.
Negative Utilitronium operationalizes these intuitions via an explicit fiscal mechanism, replacing employment with entropic restraint as the basis of income.

3. Conceptual Framework: The Inversion of Utility
Traditional utilitarianism defines value through preference satisfaction, inherently tied to action. Negative Utilitronium redefines
utility density
u
(
x
,
t
)
u(\mathbf{x},t)
u
(
x
,
t
)
as the
gradient of entropy reduction
per individual:
u

.
u = -\frac{\partial S_{local}}{\partial t}.
u

Utility thus increases when local entropy production decreases—a reversal of thermodynamic directionality in economic behavior.

6. Philosophical Implications
6.1 The Paradox of Negative Utility
If classical utilitarianism seeks maximal pleasure through maximal activity, Negative Utilitronium posits the
hedonic calm
as an equally valid teleology. The pleasure of zero-differential—existence without perturbation—becomes the ultimate good.
6.2 Cognitive Parallel
Neural energy minimization in
Friston's Free-Energy Principle
implies that cognition already seeks entropic minimization. The proposed fiscal system externalizes this neural imperative to the societal scale.
6.3 Political Economy of Restraint
The policy turns the state into a
dampener
rather than amplifier of noise. Citizens are not consumers of commodities but custodians of coherence. Governance becomes a thermodynamic function.
7. Implementation Architecture
Verification:
Privacy-preserving geofencing using zero-knowledge location proofs.
Payment Mechanism:
Central Bank Digital Currency with programmable spatial smart contracts.
Governance:
Decentralized auditing using entropy-accounting oracles (public dashboards showing national motion entropy).
8. Critiques and Counterarguments
Concern
Response
Surveillance risk
Employ homomorphic cryptography; movement data remains on device.
Economic stagnation
Transition to knowledge-based, asynchronous creative work.
Social isolation
Complementary virtual commons funded by SSA dividends.
Moral hazard (pretend stillness)
Randomized audit events; entropy-based anomalies flagged algorithmically.
9. Toward a Field Theory of Economics
We can recast the entire macroeconomy as a dissipative field:
∂
t
Φ
=
−
∇
⋅
(
Φ
v
)
+
σ
f
i
s
c
a
l
,
\partial_t \Phi = -\nabla \cdot (\Phi \mathbf{v}) + \sigma_{fiscal},
∂
t
​
Φ
=
−
∇
⋅
(
Φ
v
)
+
σ
f
i
sc

l
​
,
where
σ
f
i
s
c
a
l
\sigma_{fiscal}
σ
f
i
sc
a
l
​
acts as a
negentropic source term
proportional to stillness subsidies.
At equilibrium:
∇
⋅
(
Φ
v
)
=
σ
f
i
s
c
a
l
,
\nabla \cdot (\Phi \mathbf{v}) = \sigma_{fiscal},
∇
⋅
(
Φ
v
)
=
σ
f
i
sc
a
l
​
,
meaning fiscal spending exactly offsets the entropic flux of motion—an economic Gauss's law for entropy.
10. Conclusion: The Equilibrium of Inaction
Negative Utilitronium reimagines prosperity as
stationarity
. By tying fiscal reward to immobility, it transforms the economy from an engine of consumption into a plenum of coherence.
As entropy ceases to grow, the system enters a self-maintaining phase: the
Rest Economy
, where cost, motion, and desire reach thermodynamic parity.
