Monoidal Pop Functor
Definition 1 (Monoidal Pop Functor). The functor Pop : Sphere →[Field, Field] is defined as:
• On objects: Pop(Ω) = [FΩ, FΩ].
• On morphisms: Pop(σ) = Cσ : FΩ1 →FΩ2.
• Tensor product: For supp(σ1) ∩supp(σ2) = ∅,
Pop(σ1 ⊗σ2) = Pop(σ1) ⊗Field Pop(σ2),
where (Cσ1 ⊗Field Cσ2)(FΩ1⊔Ω2) = (Cσ1(FΩ1), Cσ2(FΩ2)).
• Unit: Pop(I) = idF∅.
With coherence maps:
• Associator: αPop : Pop((σ1 ⊗σ2) ⊗σ3) ∼
−→Pop(σ1 ⊗(σ2 ⊗σ3)).
• Left unitor: λPop : Pop(I ⊗σ) ∼
−→Pop(σ).
• Right unitor: ρPop : Pop(σ ⊗I) ∼
−→Pop(σ).
Theorem 1. Pop is a monoidal functor, satisfying:
Pop(σ1 ⊗σ2) ∼= Pop(σ1) ⊗Field Pop(σ2),
Pop(I) ∼= idF∅.

2-Category Sphere2
Definition 2 (2-Category Sphere2). The 2-category Sphere2 consists of:
• 0-cells: Regions Ω⊆Rn.
• 1-cells: Spheres σ : Ω1 →Ω2, where σ = (supp(σ), Cσ).
• 2-cells: Natural transformations τ : σ1 ⇒σ2, a family of morphisms τF : Cσ1(F) →Cσ2(F),
natural in F ∈Field(Ω1), satisfying:
F
Cσ1(F)
Cσ2(F)
Cσ2(F)
Cσ1
Cσ2
τF
id
Composition:
• Horizontal: (υ ◦τ)F = υCσ2(F) ◦τF.
• Vertical: (τ ′ · τ)F = τ ′
F ◦τF.
Identities: 1-cell idΩ= (∅, idFΩ), 2-cell idσ with components idCσ(F).
Theorem 2. Sphere2 satisfies the 2-category axioms, including associativity, identity laws, and
the interchange law.

Topos Structure
Definition 3 (Presheaf Category). The presheaf category Sphereop = [Sphereop, Set] consists of
functors P : Sphereop →Set, where:
• P(Ω): Field observations over Ω.
• P(σ : Ω1 →Ω2): Observation pullback P(Ω2) →P(Ω1).
Theorem 3. Sphereop is a topos with:
• Subobject classifier: ΩSphere = {open regions}.
• Exponentials: P Q(Ω) = HomPresheaf(Q|Sphere/Ω, P|Sphere/Ω).
• Finite limits and colimits: Computed pointwise in Set.
Theorem 4 (Internal Logic). Sphereop supports intuitionistic higher-order logic, with:
• Propositions: Subspheres of the truth sphere.
• Proofs: Sphere morphisms preserving truth.
• Quantification: Over regions and field states.
