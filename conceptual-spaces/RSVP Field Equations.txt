Field Equations of the RSVP Framework
The Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework models reality through scalar potential Φ,
vector flow v, and entropy density S fields. The evolution of the probability density ρ[Φ, v, S] over field
configurations follows:
∂tρ = ∇u · (D∇uρ) −β∇u · (ρ∇uH),
where D is the diffusion tensor, β is a coupling constant, and H is the Hamiltonian functional.
The field equations, derived from a variational principle maximizing entropy, are:
Scalar Potential (Φ):
∂tΦ = −v · ∇Φ + κ∇2Φ −λδS
δΦ,
where κ controls diffusion and λ couples to entropy.
Vector Flow (v):
∂tv + (v · ∇)v = −∇Φ −µ∇S + ν∇2v,
where µ couples to entropy gradients and ν is viscosity.
Entropy Density (S):
∂tS + ∇· (Sv) = σ|∇Φ|2 + τ|v|2 + γ∇2S,
where σ, τ, and γ govern entropy production and diffusion.
The Hamiltonian functional is:
H[Φ, v, S] =
∫(1
2|v|2 + 1
2|∇Φ|2 + S log S + V (Φ, S)
)
dV,
where V (Φ, S) encodes interaction potentials.
These equations provide a foundation for simulating RSVP dynamics and testing cosmological predic-
tions.
