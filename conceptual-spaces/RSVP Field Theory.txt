Welcome to the Deep Dive.
You know how incredible large language models are these days?
I mean, they write, they chat, they almost seem to think.
It's pretty amazing stuff.
It really is. The fluency is just staggering sometimes.
But it always makes me wonder, you know, what's actually going on under the hood?
How do they really handle meaning?
That's the million-dollar question, isn't it?
Moving beyond just the output to the internal mechanics.
Exactly. And what if?
What if we could describe how they work, maybe even how we work,
using, like, the language of physics, using math to describe thought itself?
It sounds ambitious, but that's precisely the direction some researchers are heading,
looking for the physics of cognition, you could say.
Well, that's our mission for today's Deep Dive.
We're going to explore some really fascinating,
maybe a bit mind-bending frameworks that try to do just that.
We'll be looking at the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum,
that's RSVP for Short and Relevance Activities,
and the Relativistic Relativation Theory, or R-A-T.
And, crucially, how they combine into something called RSVP-R-A-T.
The core idea is thinking about meaning, attention, even confusion,
not as fixed things, but as dynamic, evolving fields.
Like weather patterns for thoughts.
It's a path towards AI that's hopefully more interpretable, maybe more robust,
and it might even teach us something fundamental about our own minds.
Okay, so where are we getting this from?
We've got some pretty cutting-edge papers lined up.
We do.
One from work detailing the RSVP framework itself, its field equations,
the Relevance Activation Theory paper, another one integrating R-A-T into RSVP,
and even a highly theoretical one called SPHERPOP Calculus.
SPHERPOP Calculus?
What?
Sounds intense.
It's pretty abstract, yeah.
These papers together lay out this really novel mathematical
and conceptual foundation for thinking about intelligence.
All right, let's dive in.
Two core ideas to start.
First up, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum, RSVP.
All right, let's dive in.
Two core ideas to start.
First up, the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum, RSVP.
All right, let's dive in.
Two core ideas to start.
RSVP.
You said universe of meaning.
That's a good way to picture it.
RSVP essentially proposes a field theory for semantic cognition.
So instead of thinking about knowledge as like discrete bits of data.
Like entries in a database.
Right.
Instead, imagine meaning emerging from the interaction of three interconnected fields
that evolve over time across a kind of semantic landscape.
Okay, fields like in physics, but for meaning.
What are these three fields?
First, you have the scalar potential.
Let's call it phi.
Think of this as the meaning intensity or maybe the semantic value of something.
So like how important or relevant a concept is in a given context.
Exactly.
In an LLM, this could map roughly to the strength or significance of a token embedding.
It encodes value or perhaps alignment with a goal.
Okay, potential.
What's next?
Then there's the vector flow, V vector.
This captures directionality.
It's like the flow of attention or the direction of inference.
Ah.
So when an LLM attends to certain words to generate the next one, that's its vector flow.
Precisely.
It represents the path of semantic influence, the sort of agency or directed focus within
the semantic space.
And the third field, you mentioned entropy earlier.
Yes, entropy or S. Here, it's a measure of local uncertainty, semantic disorder,
or you could even think of it as cognitive load.
Cognitive load.
Like how much mental effort is involved?
Sort of.
In LLMs, it relates directly to uncertainty metrics.
Okay.
A high entropy region means the model is less certain, dealing with more possibilities,
more messiness in that area of meaning.
So these three fields, potential, flow, and entropy, they aren't just sitting there, right?
They interact.
Definitely not static.
They're constantly evolving, interacting according to complex mathematical rules, coupled nonlinear
partial differential equations for the technically minded.
Okay.
Don't need to dive too deep into the PDEs, maybe.
Probably not.
But the key takeaway is they're dynamic.
And there's this underlying principle, almost like thermodynamics, where the system explores
possibilities by sort of maximizing entropy locally, but ultimately seek stable, low entropy
states of understanding.
How does this help us with actual AI, like large language models?
What's the practical payoff?
Well, a big one is interpretability.
Imagine visualizing the vector flow, the V field.
Its streamlines could literally show you the pathways of thought or inference inside the
model.
So it's not just A to B, conceptually.
Exactly.
And the entropy field, S, becomes a diagnostic tool.
If you see a spike in entropy, or its gradient is high, that signals uncertainty or instability.
That tells you where the model might be struggling, helps you debug it.
That sounds incredibly useful.
And what about handling different types of information, like images and text together?
That's another potential strength.
RSVP provides a common language.
You can map features from text, images, audio, whatever, onto configurations of data.
So you can map features from text, images, audio, whatever, onto configurations of data.
So you can map features from text, images, audio, whatever, onto configurations of data.
So you can map features from text, images, audio, whatever, onto configurations of data.
So you can map features from text, images, audio, whatever, onto configurations of data.
So you can map features from text, images, audio, whatever, onto configurations of data.
And in this case, these are come across the same phi, V, and S fields.
So they all live in the same semantic universe.
In a way, yes.
On what the papers call a derived stack.
The vector flow, V, can then mediate attention across these modalities.
So you could have reasoning that flows seamlessly from an image concept to a text concept and
back again.
OK, that's RSVP, this dynamic field theory of meaning.
Let's switch to the second idea.
Relevance Activation Theory, or RAT.
This one sounds more focused on navigation.
It is.
RAT challenges the opportunity to process the data in various ways.
old idea of a static cognitive map in our heads you know the idea that we just look up information
like finding a street on a fixed city map right rat says no cognition is more like dynamic
navigation it's driven by cue triggered relevance fields think about how an animal explores its
environment it reacts to smells sounds sights what's relevant right now not consulting a
pre-printed map but responding to the immediate environment exactly so rit introduces this concept
of the relevance field or it's basically a function that tells you the behavioral utility
or importance of a particular mental state or piece of information given some cue a cue could
be external like a sound or internal like a thought both when a cue pops up it creates a
sort of bump or peak in this relevance field your cognitive process then naturally follows a path of
uh gradient descent on this field climbing the relevance hill so moving towards what matters most
precisely and what's cool is how this connects to neuroscience
they draw parallels to things like hippocampal place cells which seem to map spatial relevance
and hebian learning where connections are strengthened along these relevance trails
it sounds very biological almost how would this apply to ai you could design ai agents
that navigate complex problems or even physical spaces using this principle
a neural network could learn to predict the relevance field based on current cues
and then the agent just follows the gradient essentially yes using something like a soft max
it's a very dynamic way to think about goal directed behavior and for understanding our own
minds yeah beyond just navigation it gives us a framework to think about context how relevance
shifts dynamically the papers even talk about relevance as fiber bundles and attention as
vector fields really sophisticated geometrical ways of thinking about focus and you mentioned
clinical implications that seems like a leap it's speculative of course but suggestive
the idea is that maybe trauma fields deeply ingrained negative relevance patterns could
potentially be reshaped by co-activating them with new positive relevance cues kind of like
rerouting the flow and creativity creativity could be seen as exploring low energy paths
in this relevance landscape finding novel connections by following subtle
gradients that others might miss it's an intriguing perspective okay so we have
rsvp's field dynamics and rat's relevance navigation now the synthesis rsvp rat the
rsvp ìœ¤ the Fahrenheit Front well this is beginning to systemize thehop Vo
This is where rsvp there you go
and it's where things get really integrated in rsvp ri relevance r from rt gets a precise
mathematical definition using the rsvp fields how so relevance r is defined as the dot product of the
vector flow v and the gradient of the scalar potential phi rx or x oh okay breaking that down
it's how much the flow of attention v aligns with the direction where meaning intensity phi
is changing the most you got it relevance is highest when your vector flows with r and goes back to v that means problems crease from the mode there'sgeons actually programs were pleased by Oliver and others if your body does more or not implies any qualities but either of that will prove there is an importance value ofIn the correlation of Wu you've
when your attention is moving directly towards the steepest increase in meaning or value.
It elegantly connects agency and potential.
So our actual thinking process, how is that modeled?
As recursive associative trajectories, basically paths of thought, let's call them gamma,
moving through this dynamic semantic space or manifold.
And these paths are guided by?
Primarily by the vector flow, V, but with a crucial correction based on entropy UCS.
The goal is always to move towards states that are high relevance, but low entropy.
High meaning, low confusion.
Exactly.
Recursively descending towards clarity and significance.
And this combined framework gives us diagnostic tools.
You mentioned torsion before.
Right.
It introduces some powerful metrics.
Semantic torsion is a key one.
It measures the misalignment or twist between the fields,
how much the flow, V, is out of sync with the meaning gradient and the entropy gradient.
Like your thoughts are getting tangled.
Kind of, yeah.
It quantifies that sense of cognitive friction or dissonance.
And this torsion helps explain actual cognitive experiences.
That's the claim.
An insight that aha moment is modeled as a sudden drop in torsion.
Hebrew zero.
The fields rapidly align.
Uncertainty dissolve.
Wow.
And confusion.
Confusion looks like getting stuck in a high torsion state where the meaning gradient is flat.
There's no clear direction of higher meaning to move towards.
You're just spinning your wheels.
Makes sense.
What about shortcuts in thinking?
The model describes shortcutting as taking a geodesic,
like the straightest possible path through flat regions of the semantic manifold where there isn't much potential gradient to guide you more subtly.
This sounds like it could directly explain some A.I.
failures, too, especially when models give those kind of weak or superficial answers to complex questions.
Absolutely.
RSVP are at suggests that large reasoning models or L.R.M.
might produce shallow.
Outputs because of specific field problems.
Maybe they get stuck in shallow five minima finding an answer, but not the deepest or best one.
Or maybe they just don't reduce uncertainty enough.
Right.
A flat at meaning no effective entropic resolution.
Or perhaps the attention flow is just pointing in the wrong direction relative to the meaning misalignment.
Barakji leading to semantic drift.
It's fascinating that this doesn't just stand alone, but seems to absorb or generalize other cognitive theories.
We already talk.
About it really tries to be a unifying framework.
It naturally embeds ideas from predictive processing that constant prediction error cycle within the dynamics of the vector flow V and things like global workspace.
It suggests that the low entropy states the moments of clarity correspond to those broadcast trajectories proposed in global workspace theory where information becomes globally available for conscious processing and even embodiment.
Yes.
The fields aren't just abstract.
They can extend over sensor motor manifolds.
Grounding the semantics and physical interaction aligning with embodied cognition.
Okay.
This is all built on some serious math.
You mentioned higher category theory drive stacks and that's your pop calculus paper.
What's the gist of that without melting our brains?
Yeah, it's deep.
But the core idea of sphere pop calculus in this context is to provide a super rigorous mathematical language for describing how these semantic fields transform and compose across different conceptual regions.
Regions of meaning.
Exactly.
Think of spheres as representing these regions or concepts.
The calculus defines formal rules.
These monoidal pop bunkers for how operations on these regions transform the fields themselves.
It's about composing meaning transformations.
So it's the math that lets you layer meanings like understanding nuance or hierarchies.
Precisely.
It uses structures like two categories which don't just track transformations but transformations between transformations.
It captures the dynamics of how semantic relations.
The relationships themselves can shift and you mentioned the topos right.
The whole thing lives inside a topos which is a mathematical universe with its own internal logic.
This allows the system to reason about the field states and regions in a formally guaranteed way.
It's what provides the rigorous foundation for the derived stack mentioned in RSVP enabling things like unifying modalities and defining those interpret ability metrics.
So this complex math isn't just for show.
It's actually what makes the whole system work formally.
It provides the logical.
And structural bedrock.
Yeah.
It ensures that when you talk about combining or transforming semantic fields it's mathematically sound and consistent especially when dealing with complex layered meanings.
OK.
Stepping back from the deep math.
Oh why does all this matter to you.
Listening right now.
Well this isn't just theory for theory's sake.
It's a genuinely new lens for understanding intelligence.
Grasping these ideas helps you understand where I might be heading beyond just bigger models toward systems that might have a more structured.
Perhaps even more understandable internal representation of the world.
It's a shift from just looking at what AI does to trying to model how it might be doing it internally and maybe getting clues about how we do it to enhance that future AI that's not just smart but interpretable adaptable and the implications for understanding ourselves are profound.
Thinking about memory creativity even emotional processing through this lens of interacting fields it opens up entirely new questions imagine down the line.
AI that can genuinely perceive affordances in a space because its internal fields represent possibilities for action or diagnostic tools that pinpoint exactly why a reasoning process failed in an AI or maybe even in us.
The future work these papers point to is really exciting.
People are looking at actually simulating these field dynamics building new AI architectures field inspired transformers that are based on these principles and even hardware.
Yeah.
Exploring neuromorphic.
Chips designed to compute fields directly.
Plus trying to validate these ideas by looking at actual brain activity with FMRI or EEG during complex tasks trying to see if we can spot signatures of say torsion resolution during an insight moment.
We're talking about getting closer to understanding thought itself on a fundamental almost physical level.
It's a huge ambition.
So summing up we've explored this vision where meaning attention uncertainty aren't fixed symbols but dynamic interacting fields from RSVP is physics inspired universe.
And what's the latest step to understand what's the basis of meaning.
To our RIT is Q driven navigation through relevance.
And their integration in RSVP R8 which models cognition as these relevant seeking uncertainty reducing trajectories through a semantic landscape.
It really challenges us to view intelligence artificial and natural as this fluid dynamic evolving process.
So here's the final thought to leave you with.
If our thinking our moments of clarity our struggles with confusion maybe even things like trauma or creativity.
Can be described.
even metaphorically for now by the dynamics of these underlying fields what
does that ultimately mean for how we learn how we teach how we communicate
and crucially how might we eventually build machines that possess not just
intelligence but perhaps a deeper more grounded form of understanding could
cracking the physics of thought be the key to the next great leap for both AI
and our own self-understanding something to ponder
