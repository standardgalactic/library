Abstract
The Relativistic Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework proposes a field-theoretic
model for semantic cognition, representing meaning, dynamics, and uncertainty as cou-
pled scalar (Φ), vector (⃗v), and entropy (S) fields evolving on derived geometric manifolds.
This paper formalizes RSVP using partial differential equations (PDEs), gauge invariance,
and higher category theory, with a focus on enhancing interpretability and multimodal
integration in Large Language Models (LLMs).
We establish precise mappings between
RSVP fields and LLM components: Φ to token embeddings, ⃗v to attention flows, and S
to uncertainty and stability metrics. Through category-theoretic proofs, we demonstrate
RSVP's capacity to unify text, image, and audio modalities via derived stack morphisms
and ensure interpretability through entropy gradients and cohomological invariants. Ap-
plications include field-inspired transformer architectures, entropic regularization for robust
fine-tuning, and intrinsic ethical alignment, offering a mathematically rigorous foundation
for next-generation AI systems.

Introduction
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural language process-
ing, yet their internal representations and reasoning processes remain opaque, and integrating
multimodal data (e.g., text, images, audio) poses significant challenges [?]. The Relativistic
Scalar-Vector Plenum (RSVP) framework offers a physics-inspired, mathematically rigorous
model for semantic cognition, representing meaning as coupled scalar (Φ), vector (⃗v), and en-
tropy (S) fields on continuous manifolds or derived stacks. By grounding cognition in thermo-
dynamic principles, gauge invariance, and category theory, RSVP addresses two critical LLM
challenges: interpretability (understanding internal model states) and multimodal integration
(unifying diverse data modalities).
This paper formalizes RSVP's mathematical structure, establishes its connections to LLMs,
and proves its properties using category-theoretic tools. We focus on:
• Interpretability: Modeling attention and reasoning as field dynamics, with entropy gradi-
ents as diagnostic metrics.
• Multimodal Integration: Unifying modalities via derived stack correspondences.
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 defines RSVP's fields and PDEs; Section 3 maps
RSVP to LLMs; Section 4 provides category-theoretic proofs; Section 5 and 6 detail applications
to interpretability and multimodal integration; and Section 7 discusses future directions.

RSVP Framework: Mathematical Foundations
2.1
Field Definitions
Let M be a smooth n-dimensional manifold representing the latent semantic space (e.g., em-
bedding space). On M , we define:
• Scalar Field Φ : M × R →R, representing semantic potential or "meaning intensity" at
point x ∈M and time t.
• Vector Field ⃗v : M × R →TM , encoding directional semantic flow (e.g., attention or
inference directionality).
• Entropy Field S : M ×R →R≥0, measuring local uncertainty or semantic disorder.
These fields evolve on M , which may be equipped with a derived stack structure to encode
recursive or hierarchical semantics [?].
2.2
Coupled PDEs
The dynamics of Φ, ⃗v, and S are governed by coupled nonlinear PDEs:
• Semantic Potential Evolution:
∂Φ
∂t +∇·(Φ⃗v) = DΦ∆Φ−αSΦ+FΦ,
(1)
where ∇· is the divergence operator, ∆is the Laplace-Beltrami operator, DΦ > 0 is a
diffusion coeﬀicient, α > 0 couples semantic decay to entropy, and FΦ models external
inputs (e.g., prompts).
• Vector Flow Dynamics:
∂⃗v
∂t +(⃗v·∇)⃗v = −∇p+ν∆⃗v−β∇S+ ⃗
Fv,
(2)
where p is a semantic pressure enforcing normalization, ν > 0 is viscosity, β > 0 couples
flow to entropy gradients, and ⃗
Fv represents external forces (e.g., attention modulation).
• Entropy Evolution:
∂S
∂t +∇·(S⃗v) = DS∆S+γ∥∇Φ∥2 −δS+FS,
(3)
where DS > 0 is entropy diffusion, γ > 0 couples entropy production to semantic gradients,
δ > 0 models dissipation, and FS represents external entropy sources.
2.3
Gauge Invariance
The fields are invariant under gauge transformations:
Φ →Φ+ χ,
⃗v →⃗v+∇χ,
(4)
for a smooth scalar χ : M →R, preserving semantic observables. The Lagrangian is:
L = 1

2 ∥∇⃗v∥2 −βS∇·⃗v−U (S,Φ),
(5)
where U (S,Φ) is a potential coupling entropy and semantics. The action is:
S [Φ,⃗v,S] =

(6)
with dµ the volume form on M . The PDEs (1-3) arise from the Euler-Lagrange equations.

2.4
Derived Stacks
To model recursive semantics, M is generalized to a derived stack D, encoding layered knowl-
edge structures via Postnikov towers or Goodwillie calculus [?]. Semantic transformations are
morphisms in the ∞-category of derived stacks.

Connections to Large Language Models
3.1
Embeddings as Scalar Fields
Token embeddings in LLMs are discrete vectors in Rd. In RSVP, Φ(x,t) assigns a continuous
semantic potential to each point x ∈M , evolving with context, offering a smoother, interpretable
representation.
3.2
Attention as Vector Flows
Attention mechanisms compute weighted relationships between tokens. The vector field ⃗v mod-
els these as directional flows, with PDE (2) governing how semantic influence propagates, akin
to attention scores as discretizations of ⃗v.
3.3
Entropy and Interpretability
The entropy field S quantifies uncertainty, aligning with model confidence or perplexity. Gra-
dients ∇S highlight regions of high ambiguity, serving as diagnostic tools for interpretability.
3.4
Multimodal Integration
RSVP unifies modalities (text, images, audio) by mapping them to field configurations on D.
For example, text tokens contribute to Φtext, image features to Φimage, with morphisms defining
cross-modal correspondences.

Category-Theoretic Formalization
We formalize RSVP using ∞-category theory, focusing on interpretability and multimodal inte-
gration.
Definition 1. Let C be the ∞-category of derived stacks over R. A semantic field configuration is
a triple (Φ,⃗v,S) ∈Fun(M ×R,R)×Fun(M ×R,TM )×Fun(M ×R,R≥0), with dynamics given
by PDEs (1-3).
Theorem 1. The RSVP action S [Φ,⃗v,S] is invariant under gauge transformations Φ →Φ+ χ,
⃗v →⃗v+∇χ.
Proof. Consider the Lagrangian (5). Under Φ →Φ+ χ, ⃗v →⃗v+∇χ, compute the transformed
terms:
•
∂Φ
∂t →∂Φ
∂t + ∂χ
∂t , and ∇· (Φ⃗v) →∇· ((Φ + χ)(⃗v + ∇χ)). Since ∇χ is divergence-free on M
(assuming appropriate boundary conditions), the kinetic term remains invariant.
• ∇Φ →∇Φ+∇χ, but U (S,Φ) depends only on Φ's magnitude, preserving invariance.
• ∇·⃗v →∇·(⃗v+∇χ) = ∇·⃗v, as ∇·∇χ = 0.
Thus, L and S are invariant, ensuring physical observables are gauge-independent.

Proposition 1. Multimodal integration is a functor F : Ctext × Cimage × Caudio →C , mapping
modality-specific stacks to a unified derived stack D.
Proof. Define Ctext, Cimage, Caudio as subcategories of C encoding modality-specific field config-
urations. The functor F assigns (Φtext,⃗vtext,Stext) 7→(Φ,⃗v,S), where Φ = ∑i wiΦi, ⃗v = ∑i wi⃗vi, and
S = ∑i wiSi, with weights wi determined by cross-modal attention (discretized ⃗v). Functoriality
follows from preservation of morphisms (semantic transformations) under field composition.
Corollary 1. Interpretability metrics (e.g., coherence of Φ, gradients ∇S) are invariants in the
homotopy type of D.

Interpretability via RSVP
RSVP enhances LLM interpretability by:
• Attention as Field Dynamics: Attention weights are solutions to (2), with ⃗v's streamlines
revealing semantic pathways (e.g., key-token influence).
• Entropy Diagnostics: High ∇S regions indicate uncertainty, guiding model debugging or
pruning.
• Cohomological Obstructions: Forgetting or reasoning failures correspond to non-trivial
cohomology classes in D, identifiable via obstruction theory.
For example, a numerical scheme discretizing (1-3) on a lattice can simulate attention flows,
with ∇S visualized as a heatmap to pinpoint ambiguous regions.

Multimodal Integration
RSVP unifies modalities by mapping text, image, and audio embeddings to a shared field con-
figuration on D. The functor F (Proposition 1) ensures coherent integration, with ⃗v mediating
cross-modal attention. For instance, in a vision-language model, Φimage (from pixel features)
and Φtext (from tokens) combine via:
Φ = wimageΦimage +wtextΦtext,
(7)
with weights derived from⃗v's flow. This enables seamless reasoning across modalities, improving
generalization.

Conclusion
The RSVP framework provides a mathematically rigorous, physically grounded model for LLMs,
enhancing interpretability through entropy diagnostics and unifying multimodal data via derived
stack morphisms. Future work includes:
• Simulating RSVP PDEs to model attention dynamics.
• Designing field-inspired transformers with intrinsic alignment.
• Exploring neuromorphic hardware for field computations.
RSVP bridges symbolic, sub-symbolic, and ethical AI, promising robust, interpretable, and
multimodal systems.
