 This paper establishes a formal correspondence between two distinct frameworks addressing these questions: Julian Barbour’s relational configuration space, where the universe’s history is a smooth curve in a symmetry-reduced manifold $C$, with the arrow tied to complexity growth from a low-complexity Janus point \citep{Barbour1999,Barbour2014}, and the Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) field theory, which models the universe as a triple of interacting fields—a scalar potential $\Phi$, a vector flux $\mathbf{v}$, and an entropy density $S$—evolving via entropic smoothing toward lower-energy configurations under negentropic constraints. By constructing RSVP fields as sections of a sheaf $\mathscr{F}$ over $C$, with dynamics governed by a fiberwise gradient-flow endofunctor $\mathcal{D}$, we demonstrate that the projection functor $\pi_*: \mathbf{Sh}(\mathscr{F}) \to \mathbf{Sh}(C)$ maps $\mathcal{D}$ to Barbour’s geodesic-flow functor $\mathcal{G}$, satisfying the naturality condition $\pi_* \circ \mathcal{D} = \mathcal{G} \circ \pi_*$. This sheaf–functor equivalence unifies the relational and field-theoretic perspectives, reframing the arrow of time as a property of commutative dynamics across geometric and physical domains.
 
 To elucidate this correspondence, each section includes a detailed exposition in formal mathematical language, followed by a concise précis summarizing the key formal constructs, a thought experiment featuring Maxim Kammerer from Arkadi and Boris Strugatsky’s \textit{Prisoner of Power} and \textit{Hard to Be a God}, where cross-sectional analysis of a Noonverse Ringworld’s developmental zones reconstructs a universal temporal order, and an everyday example applying the concepts to familiar systems. These illustrations draw parallels to deriving stellar lifecycles from a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram or universal functions from null wavefronts in null convention logic (NCL), using NCL-inspired Markov blankets to filter validated data and collapse higher-category circuits into sequential or parallel forms.

 The modern debate over the nature of time originates with Newton’s absolute time—a universal, uniformly flowing parameter—contrasted by Leibniz’s and Mach’s relational view, where time emerges from changes in material configurations \citep{Barbour1999}. Relativity integrates time into a four-dimensional spacetime manifold \citep{Rovelli2015}, while quantum mechanics often retains an external time parameter, perpetuating a conceptual divide \citep{Ellis2012}. The arrow of time, manifesting as experiential and physical asymmetry, is variably attributed to thermodynamic entropy increase \citep{Jaynes1957}, statistical coarse-graining, cosmological initial conditions \citep{Ellis2012}, or complexity growth from a minimal state \citep{Barbour2014}. These explanations struggle to bridge abstract principles with the concrete dynamics of the universe’s evolution.
 
 Barbour’s relational framework defines a configuration space $C$ as the quotient of all instantaneous configurations by symmetries, with history as a smooth curve in $C$ and the arrow as monotonic complexity growth from a Janus point \citep{Barbour1999, Barbour2014}. Field-theoretic approaches, conversely, describe the universe via fields evolving under local laws, with the arrow tied to dissipative processes like gradient smoothing \citep{Prigogine1997}. The Relativistic Scalar–Vector Plenum (RSVP) posits three fields: a scalar potential $\Phi$ encoding smoothness, a vector flux $\mathbf{v}$ for momentum transport, and an entropy density $S$ for local disorder. Its dynamics, governed by entropic smoothing, define time as a causal sequence of admissible state transitions, with the arrow as constraint reduction in macro-slicings \citep{Jaynes1957}.
