1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,340
Welcome back to the deep dive. I want to start today with a mental image. It might sound a little

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,220
bit cliche at first, but just just stay with me on this. Okay, I'm with you. I want you to picture

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:19,160
the ultimate machine, the perfect clockwork universe. Right. Brass gears, intricate springs,

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,620
the whole thing. Endless brass gears. You can see them turning, springs coiling up, pistons firing

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,520
with, you know, perfect precision. It's engineered. It is completely deterministic. So if you know

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,560
where one gear is, you know where everything else is going to be. Exactly. And that image,

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:44,020
that clock has really been our dominant metaphor for, for how things work for what, 300 years? At

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,460
least since Newton, really. But now I want you to take that machine in your mind and I want you to

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,880
break it. Break it? How? Just melt it down. Watch the brass soften. The gears start to lose their

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,460
teeth. Watch them dissolve into something organic. Okay. And suddenly you're not looking at a machine

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,700
anymore. You're looking at a coral reef. Ah, okay. That's a massive shift in texture from cold metal

12
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,960
to, to life. Right. It's messy. It feels almost chaotic. You've got thousands of different species

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,640
interacting. They're eating. They're dying. They're growing on top of each other. It's a

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,560
teeming biological ecosystem. I'm with you. The clock and the reef. So here's the question that

15
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,900
really launches our whole investigation today. Which one of those two images, the perfect clock

16
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:41,300
or the messy reef, is actually more complex? Well, that's a trap of a question, isn't it? It is a bit

17
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,580
of a trap. Because historically, science and, you know, especially the field of artificial intelligence

18
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,960
would have pointed straight at the clock without hesitation. Why? Because we built it. Because we

19
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,780
can explain it. We love the clock because it's rational. It's reducible. We look at the reef and

20
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,020
we just see, well, chaos. We wave our hands and call it nature or instinct. Exactly. And it's that

21
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:11,180
bias, that deep-seated preference for the engineered over the organic that we are going to try and

22
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,540
dismantle today. It's a big project. It is. We're opening up a file that I genuinely think is going

23
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:25,300
to fundamentally change how you, the listener, look at intelligence and complexity. The paper is titled

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,900
Complexity Without Intelligence. It's by a researcher named Flixian, and it was just published January 24,

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,500
2026. And that title alone is, I mean, it's deliberately provocative. Complexity Without Intelligence.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:46,840
It feels like an oxymoron, right? A contradiction in terms. We are just so trained to think that

27
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,820
smart equals complex. It's our default setting. If I show you a supercomputer that's, you know,

28
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:58,840
beating a grandmaster at chess, you're going to say, wow, that is a complex system. Of course.

29
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,540
But if I show you a common garden spider weaving this incredibly intricate, beautiful web,

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,780
you're probably going to say, well, that's just instinct. That's just biology doing its thing.

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,080
We dismiss it. We dismiss the spider. We assume that because the spider isn't consciously thinking

32
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,020
about, I don't know, the tensile strength of its own silk or calculating the geometric angles in its

33
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:27,020
head, that the activity itself must be simple. But Flixian is here to argue that we have this

34
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:33,840
completely fundamentally backward. The mission of this paper, and really our mission for this deep dive,

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,580
is to take a scalpel and surgically separate two ideas that have been glued together for decades.

36
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:46,860
And those two ideas are? What an agent knows so, its intelligence, its ability to learn, and what an

37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,880
agent does, its complexity. And to really appreciate why that's such a heavy lift, you have to understand

38
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,500
the sheer amount of historical baggage we're all carrying. What do you mean?

39
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:06,140
Well, for the last 70 years or so, cognitive science, AI, philosophy of mind, they've all been

40
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:09,400
completely obsessed with the internal.

41
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,300
The brain.

42
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,200
The brain, the CPU, the little ghost in the machine.

43
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,640
We're always trying to peek inside the black box.

44
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,220
Precisely. We measure an agent's complexity by looking for evidence internal deliberation.

45
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,860
We look for planning. We look for reasoning. And most of all, we look for the ability to learn

46
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,540
new tricks.

47
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,460
And if a system can't learn, we basically write it off. We call it dumb or brittle.

48
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,380
We do. But this paper argues that this view is just incredibly narrow. It's like looking at the

49
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:49,760
world through a keyhole. It misses the staggering, mind-boggling complexity of systems that just work.

50
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,820
Systems that don't have to think about it.

51
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,580
Systems that function perfectly in the present moment, whether or not they have an inner life

52
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:59,940
or are consciously deliberating about their actions.

53
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,260
You mentioned before we started that we have this habit of ranking things, like some cosmic

54
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,660
leaderboard of existence.

55
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,180
Oh, we're obsessed with it. It's the great chain of being all over again. You've got humans at the

56
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,000
very top naturally.

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:13,740
Of course.

58
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,780
Then maybe chimps, then dogs, maybe dolphins if we're feeling generous. And then way,

59
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,160
way down to the bottom, you've got the insects and-

60
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,500
And the poor Roombas.

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
And the poor Roombas.

62
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,940
But the point is, we rank them based on one single criterion. How close are they to us?

63
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,300
How close do they come to mimicking human-style cognition?

64
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,680
That's what Fliction calls the deliberation bias, right?

65
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,440
We confuse the complexity of an action with the perceived effort of thinking really hard

66
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,340
about that action.

67
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,340
Okay. So the paper identifies this huge problem, this bias. What's the solution it offers? It

68
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,280
proposes a new framework.

69
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,040
It does. They call it an affordance-based account.

70
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,560
Right. Now, affordance is a word that gets thrown around a lot, you know, in user experience,

71
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,840
design, in psychology. But how is it being used here? It feels very specific.

72
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,860
It's very specific, and it signals a fundamental pivot. We are pivoting away from trying to count

73
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,500
how much RAM an agent has or how many neurons are in its frontal cortex.

74
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,580
But we're not looking inside the box anymore.

75
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,860
We're looking at the relationship between the agent and its environment.

76
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,620
The relationship. Okay. That feels like the key.

77
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,320
It is. The central claim here is that complexity isn't something you carry around inside your head

78
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,580
like a wallet. Complexity is something that happens between you and the world. It emerges

79
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,520
in the interaction.

80
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:48,040
Okay. I want to dig into that relationship a lot more. But first, let's establish the first

81
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,840
big pillar of the paper's argument, this concept of synchronic complexity.

82
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,860
Yes. This is the absolute foundation for everything else.

83
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,540
Synchronic? It sounds, I don't know, like a heavy metal band or maybe a fiercely technical

84
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,260
term from linguistics.

85
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,960
It actually does come from linguistics. From Saussure. He made this distinction. You have

86
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,920
diachronic linguistics, which is the study of how language changes over time. You know,

87
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,120
its history, its evolution.

88
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,600
Right. Like how Latin became French and Spanish.

89
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,720
Exactly. And then you have synchronic linguistics, which studies the language system as it exists

90
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,060
at one specific point in time. A snapshot. Frozen.

91
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,220
So when Fliction talks about synchronic complexity, they're asking us to take a snapshot and completely

92
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,260
ignore the history.

93
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,520
Completely and utterly.

94
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:39,980
Yeah.

95
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,220
Forget how the agent got to be the way it is. Forget if it evolved over millions of years

96
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:50,740
of natural selection. Forget if it was programmed by a genius five minutes ago. Forget if it learned

97
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,360
a skill through 10,000 hours of practice.

98
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,880
You're saying none of that matters.

99
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,160
For measuring synchronic complexity, no. We don't care. We are asking one simple question.

100
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,540
What can this agent do with rich, structured competence right now?

101
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:14,520
Okay. But that seems a little unfair to the learners, doesn't it? I mean, if I spent 10 years

102
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,520
of my life learning to play the piano and you build a robot that can just play it instantly,

103
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,980
don't I get some credit for all that effort?

104
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,020
Oh, absolutely. You get enormous credit for intelligence. You get credit for having a powerful

105
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:33,380
learning capacity. But the paper makes a very sharp distinction here. It argues you do not get

106
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,380
extra credit for the complexity of the performance itself.

107
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,620
So if the robot plays the concerto perfectly and I play it perfectly...

108
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,020
The complexity of the activity, the organized, goal-directed behavior, is identical in that

109
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,400
moment.

110
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,300
Ah, okay. I see the line they're drawing. It's really about separating the journey from the

111
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:52,860
destination.

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,180
Precisely. And they don't just state this, they formalize it. And I think it's worth just touching

113
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,860
on the logic, even if we skip the deep math.

114
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,560
Go for it.

115
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,560
They create two distinct variables. There's TCA, TT, T-day, which is the complexity of agent

116
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,380
A at a specific time T.

117
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:16,860
Right. C of A at time T. That T is doing a lot of work there, emphasizing the now.

118
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,520
It is. And then there's a completely separate variable, the learners, which stands for the

119
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,760
learning operator. That's the agent's ability to change its complexity over time.

120
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
So it's ability to get better or worse.

121
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:36,140
Exactly. And here's the paper's most radical claim. TAA, AT, and LRLers are independent variables.

122
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,400
They're not necessarily correlated.

123
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:45,080
Meaning, you can have an agent with incredibly high complexity, but basically zero ability

124
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,660
to learn.

125
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:51,800
Exactly. And conversely, you can have an agent with a massive capacity for learning, but very

126
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,560
low complexity in the present moment.

127
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Give me an example of that second one. High learning, low complexity.

128
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,600
A human baby. An infant is arguably the most powerful learning machine on the planet. Its LRL value

129
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,560
is off the charts. It's just this incredible sponge for information and new skills.

130
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,920
But it's TAA. TAA. Its ability to actually do stuff right here, right now. It's pretty low. I mean,

131
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,400
it can barely hold its own head up. It can't navigate. It can't feed itself. Its present moment

132
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,560
complexity is minimal.

133
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,480
Okay. Versus the spider.

134
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,300
Versus the spider. The spider might have a learning operator that's close to zero. It's not going to

135
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:38,420
learn calculus. It probably won't even learn how to weave a fundamentally new style of web if you move

136
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:45,460
it to a different continent. It's fixed. It's largely fixed. But it's CA. The geometric precision

137
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:52,000
of the web. The material science of handling the silk. The vibration sensing it's performing right

138
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,080
this second to monitor for prey. That is astronomically high. So for decades, we've been judging the spider

139
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,740
for being stupid because its cellios is low, while completely ignoring that its city A-T-Feo is performing

140
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,060
a feat of engineering that our most advanced robots still struggle to replicate.

141
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,280
That's the internal bias again. We've been looking for the brain that learns and we've totally missed

142
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,940
the body that performs so beautifully.

143
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,680
This leads directly to the idea of fluency. And I have to admit, this is the part of the paper that

144
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,440
really flicked my entire perspective upside down.

145
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,420
I had the same reaction.

146
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,320
Because usually if I do something without thinking, I consider that, well, mindless. Like,

147
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,080
I'm on autopilot. And we usually use autopilot as a criticism.

148
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,720
You're just phoning it in. You're not really present.

149
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,440
Right. But Felines comes along and says that autopilot, or what they call fluency,

150
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,780
is actually a sign of higher complexity, not lower.

151
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,160
It's what I call the paradox of proficiency. The better you get at something, the less you think

152
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,560
about it.

153
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,840
Walk me through an example.

154
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,420
Okay. Think about a student who's learning a second language for the first time. Let's say

155
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,100
it's an American student in Paris trying to order a cup of coffee.

156
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,520
A universally high-stress situation.

157
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:15,360
Incredibly high-stress. Their brain is firing on all cylinders. They are consciously accessing

158
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,640
vocabulary, wrestling with grammar. They're translating every single word in their head.

159
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:29,060
Je voudrais un café. They are deliberating. They're using massive amounts of intelligence

160
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,620
and working memory.

161
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,100
They are thinking very, very hard.

162
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,500
Now, look at the Parisian locals standing in line next to them. They lean over and order

163
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,020
their coffee while simultaneously scrolling on their phone, maybe lighting a cigarette,

164
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,220
and dodging a person walking by.

165
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,780
They don't think about the French at all.

166
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,440
Not for a second. They are fluent. Now, who is exhibiting more complexity in that moment?

167
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:58,120
Well, my old intuition would say the student because their brain is working harder. But based

168
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,740
on this paper, it's the local.

169
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:07,040
It's the local by a landslide because the local can sustain multiple modes of activity at the same

170
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,480
time. They can engage in a social transaction, process information from their phone, perform a

171
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,860
motor task like lighting a cigarette, and navigate physical space all at once.

172
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,040
Whereas the student is completely consumed by the single task, they're paralyzed by it.

173
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,500
The student is brittle. The local is robust.

174
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,260
Brittle versus robust. That feels like a really key distinction. The student is brittle because

175
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,060
if the barista asks an unexpected follow-up question like, do you want sugar with that?

176
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
Their whole system crashes.

177
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,600
Exactly. They have to reboot the whole deliberation process. The local adapts instantly without even

178
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,220
breaking their stride. The paper's point is that deliberation, that process of stopping and thinking

179
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,000
is actually a cognitive bottleneck. It consumes precious resources.

180
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,180
So fluency frees up those resources.

181
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,640
It frees them up, which allows you to layer more activities on top. So in this framework,

182
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,260
not thinking, is a superpower.

183
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,700
It's the ultimate role of complexity, to push all the difficult stuff into the background so

184
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,240
you can interact with the world on a higher, more integrated level.

185
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,800
You've got it.

186
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,920
I want to pause on that term modes of activity for a second. The paper defines them as stable,

187
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:32,200
goal-explainable patterns of engagement. But isn't there a danger in defining complexity by

188
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,580
stability? I mean, a rock is very stable.

189
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,020
Ah, that's a fair challenge.

190
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:40,980
A rock has a very stable pattern of engagement with the ground. It just sits there. It's a rock

191
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,460
complex.

192
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:47,900
It's a valid pushback. But the key is in the second part of the definition. Goal-explainable

193
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:54,840
patterns of engagement. A rock isn't really engaging with the environment to solve a problem

194
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:00,360
related to its own viability. It's just being subjected to the laws of physics, like gravity.

195
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,980
It's passive. It's passive. The person ordering coffee is actively solving multiple viability

196
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,840
problems simultaneously. Social interaction, caffeine acquisition, information gathering,

197
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,240
nictine addiction, navigation. They are juggling multiple balls to maintain their state.

198
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,340
The rock isn't juggling anything.

199
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,600
Okay. So complexity is the number of balls you can keep in the air at once.

200
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,340
Without having to consciously look at any of them.

201
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,080
That's a fantastic way to put it. The more you can do without deliberation, the higher

202
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,460
your synchronic complexity.

203
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,180
Exactly.

204
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,840
Which brings us right back to that crucial relationship with the world. We've established

205
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,700
that we're looking at the now, and we're looking for fluent, layered activity. But where does

206
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:51,320
this flow actually happen? It happens in what the paper calls the affordance landscape.

207
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,860
The landscape of possibilities. It's the space you move through.

208
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,660
Let's switch the visual in our heads again. The clock is gone. The reef is gone. Now I want you

209
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:07,580
to picture a map. A massive, stylized subway map, like the London Underground map, with thousands

210
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
of lines diverging and converging.

211
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,320
That's a great image for it. That's the activity space. And each station, each potential stop

212
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,300
is an affordance.

213
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:22,220
Okay, so let's define affordance again, but really strictly in this relational sense, because

214
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:28,160
I think people, myself included, can get tripped up thinking an affordance is just a feature.

215
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,480
You know, my phone has the camera affordance.

216
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,440
Right, and that's not quite it. It's not a feature of the object, and it's not a skill

217
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,660
of the user. It is the handshake between the two. The potential for a meaningful interaction.

218
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,540
The classic example is a chair.

219
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,380
Right. The classic example is a chair. Does a simple wooden chair have the affordance

220
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,280
of sitability?

221
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:53,060
Well, yes. Of course. That's what it's for.

222
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:00,160
For you, a human, yes. Your body has the right size, the right joint structure. The chair has

223
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,680
the right height, the right flat surface. The relationship works. The affordance of sitting

224
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,600
exists in that coupling.

225
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,020
But what if you're an elephant?

226
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:14,680
Then the chair is absolutely not for sitting. For an elephant, it might afford being smashed

227
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,220
or being a minor obstacle. But the sitting affordance does not exist for the elephant

228
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,100
chair coupling. It's gone.

229
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:28,260
The paper uses a slightly more terrifying example. The affordance of breathing.

230
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,600
Right. Let's look at the formula they use, just conceptually.

231
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,660
Four netters is the set of all affordances, all activities, available to you at time, $10.

232
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,320
My menu of options.

233
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,380
Your menu of options. Right now, sitting in this studio, the activity breathing is on

234
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,360
your menu. It's in your set four netters. You have lungs. That's the agent's contribution.

235
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:56,200
And the room has air. That's the environment's contribution. The relation holds.

236
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,280
But if you take me and drop me in the middle of the Pacific Ocean...

237
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,980
Your internal machinery hasn't changed one bit. You still have the same lungs. You're just

238
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,100
as smart. You have the same memories, the same capabilities you had a moment before.

239
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,700
But the environment has changed.

240
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,000
The environment has changed dramatically. The air is gone. The relation is broken. And

241
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,180
so the breathing affordance instantly vanishes from your set affordance.

242
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,680
And my overall complexity drops to zero pretty quickly after that.

243
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:29,920
Tragically so. But it proves the point with brutal clarity. Complexity isn't something you

244
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,580
just carry around inside your skin. It's relational.

245
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:40,240
So a supercomputer. A machine with more processing power than all of humanity combined. If you just

246
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,140
float it in the vacuum of space.

247
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,020
It has almost zero complexity. It has no inputs to process. No outputs to affect the world.

248
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,500
It can't do anything. It's just a warm, inert box.

249
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:58,240
This really dismantles those old brain-in-a-vat thought experiments, doesn't it? We used to think

250
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,740
if we could just perfectly simulate a brain, it would be conscious and complex all by itself.

251
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,540
And this framework, which is part of a broader movement called inactivism, says that's nonsense.

252
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,980
You are not a brain riding a body like a driver in a car. You are the entire coupled system of brain,

253
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,760
body, and world all acting together.

254
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,160
So if you take a simple organism, let's go back to our spider, and you put it in a really rich,

255
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,000
complex environment with lots of anchor points, wind currents, different kinds of prey.

256
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,580
Its activity space, its set of affordances just explodes. The spider in the rich environment

257
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,400
system becomes incredibly complex.

258
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,800
So this is the relational view. Complexity is what you can do with what you have, where you are.

259
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,760
It's not additive. You can't just keep adding more parts to the robot to make it more complex.

260
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,400
Yeah. You have to design the robot to better couple with its world.

261
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,200
Okay. And that coupling, that idea of the affordance landscape,

262
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,680
leads us to a really counterintuitive point. I think this is in section three.

263
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,980
Yes. Constraints.

264
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,580
Right. If complexity is about having options, about having a big, diverse menu of affordances,

265
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:12,820
then surely the goal is to have all the options. Infinite affordances.

266
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,220
I want to be able to fly and breathe underwater and see through walls.

267
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,240
I'd definitely take the flight option.

268
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,000
Me too. But the paper argues that infinite options wouldn't just be unhelpful,

269
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,780
they would actually destroy you. This is a section on constraints and the power of no.

270
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,740
It's one of my favorite parts of the paper.

271
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,540
So explain this to me. Why would no be powerful? Why is can't sometimes better than can?

272
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:44,980
It all comes down to the problem of information processing. Think about the concept of absence,

273
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,080
as the paper puts it. Some affordances are absent simply because they are physically impossible for

274
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:58,840
you. Like me trying to fly by flapping my arms. Exactly. That is a hard constraint imposed on you

275
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,600
by gravity and your own biology. Now you might see that as a limitation. A bummer.

276
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:12,540
It is a bummer. But the paper argues it's an incredible gift because constraint is prior to

277
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,660
choice. What does that mean prior to choice? It means that because that option is physically

278
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:22,380
impossible, your brain and your body do not have to waste a single calorie, a single millisecond,

279
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,460
even considering it. Yeah. The decision has been made for you by the universe. I see. So when I'm

280
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,520
standing at the edge of a cliff, I don't have this complex internal debate. Hmm. Should I flap my wings?

281
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,720
Today? Or should I take the stairs? The universe has already removed flap my wings from my menu.

282
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,720
It's already crossed it off for you. Now imagine if you could do anything. Imagine if every single

283
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,660
atom in this room was a valid handle for you to grab. Imagine if every direction was a valid path

284
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:56,620
for locomotion, including straight up. I'd be paralyzed. I wouldn't even know where to start.

285
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,620
It's overwhelming. We call that combinatorial explosion in computer science. If the number of

286
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,840
possibilities is nearly infinite, the time it would take to calculate the best one also becomes

287
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,500
infinite. You would just freeze, trapped by choice. So constraints act like, what, blinders on a horse?

288
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,940
That's a perfect analogy. They cut off all the peripheral noise and distraction,

289
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,640
so you can just move forward on the path that's actually available to you.

290
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,820
The paper talks about a relevance function here. It uses the Greek letter row.

291
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:33,760
Right. The relevance function one rowway is the great filter. In this mathematical model,

292
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,760
all the irrelevant or impossible activities, like you trying to fly or trying to walk through that

293
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,080
solid wall, they get a relevance score of zero. So they're filtered out before they even reach my

294
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:52,320
decision-making process. They never even enter the dynamics. This is what the paper calls the

295
00:22:52,320 --> 00:23:01,120
economization of activity. By making 99.9% of all theoretical actions impossible, nature allows us

296
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:07,000
to become really, really good at the tiny fraction that is possible. I love the analogy of the musician

297
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,200
for this. I think it makes it really clear. Well, if you sit a musician down on a piano and say,

298
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:18,540
play any note that exists in the universe, they might just produce noise. It's too open. But if

299
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:25,360
you give them a key signature, say B-flat minor, you're imposing a constraint. You're limiting their

300
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:33,180
options. You're saying, don't play these six notes, only play these other ones. Yes. But that very

301
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:39,580
limitation is what creates the structure. Because they don't have to waste brainpower thinking about

302
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:46,000
all the wrong notes, they can now creatively and fluently explore the rich relationships between

303
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,340
all the right notes. The constraint enables the complexity. That is a perfect encapsulation of

304
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:58,200
the argument. Structure is just a positive-sounding word for constraint. You can't build a complex

305
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,440
skyscraper without rigid steel beams that limit where the floors and walls can go. Without those limits,

306
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,880
you don't have a building, you just have a pile of bricks. So, okay, let's recap where we are.

307
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,780
We have the now, which is synchronic. We have the relation, which is the affordance.

308
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,660
And we have the limit, which is the constraint. The three pillars so far.

309
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,700
But let's look at the structure of these activities themselves.

310
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,320
Section four of the paper is called structure, composition, and automation.

311
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,780
Right. Because your affordance landscape, your menu of options, isn't just a flat,

312
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,740
unorganized list. It's not a grocery list. Eat, sleep, walk, talk.

313
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:41,080
It has a hierarchy. Exactly. It has a hierarchy. The paper makes a distinction between basic

314
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:46,660
affordances and composite affordances. Okay. What's the difference? Basic affordances are the

315
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,900
sort of atomic units of action. They're the Lego bricks. Things like grasping an object with your

316
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:58,080
hand, focusing your eyes on a point, lifting a single foot. And composite affordances are the

317
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,820
complex structures you build out of those Lego bricks, like making a sandwich.

318
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,780
Making a sandwich is a perfect example. Or driving a car. You can't just drive a car

319
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,060
as a single action. You have to perform a whole sequence of basic affordances.

320
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Turn the wheel, press the pedal, look in the mirror, move the shifter. You chain them together

321
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,260
in a stable pattern. But here's the crucial part, and it gets back to fluency. If I had to consciously

322
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:30,480
think about every single one of those basic affordances while making a sandwich, I'd starve to

323
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,960
death before I ever got to eat. Okay. Now I must grasp the knife. Now apply downward pressure.

324
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,640
Now slice the bread. Now stop slicing. It would take forever.

325
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:48,320
And this brings us to what might be the most important mechanism for complexity growth in

326
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,200
the entire paper. Relegation of control.

327
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,520
Relegation. It sounds like you're being demoted or sent away.

328
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,160
In this context, it's a huge promotion for the system's overall efficiency.

329
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,240
When a composite activity like driving or making a sandwich becomes stable and reliable through

330
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,920
practice, the agent stops consciously managing the details.

331
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,160
You stop thinking about turning the wheel and you start thinking about the goal, like going to the

332
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,120
store. Precisely. The low-level details get compressed and automated. They get chunked together.

333
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,640
The paper has a term for this, right? The projection operator.

334
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
Yes. The projection operator, which they denote with a dollar.

335
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,320
The math is a bit dense, but the concept is beautiful. Imagine taking a thousand tiny distinct

336
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,440
gods that represent your basic actions and then drawing a big circle around them and giving that

337
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,920
whole collection a single simple label. One thing.

338
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,120
So turn wheel, press gas, check mirror becomes drive.

339
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,400
It gets projected onto a simpler higher level description.

340
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,800
You now treat that complex chain of actions as if it were a single basic unit. This is the

341
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,320
automation we were talking about earlier.

342
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,040
And this solves the manager problem, the homunculus fallacy. Tell me more about that.

343
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,520
Well, there's this old sort of fallacy in AI and cognitive science that for a system to be

344
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,880
coordinated, you need a central executive or a manager in the brain that's supervising everything,

345
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,120
a little man in the head pulling all the levers. And this model says you don't need that little

346
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:27,040
man. Right. If the system can automate its own subroutines, if the legs can just handle the walking

347
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,760
so the brain doesn't have to, you don't need a manager for the legs. You relegate control.

348
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:39,520
You relegate the control down to the limbs themselves or to the spinal cord or to the

349
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,840
cerebellum, to these subconscious embodied habits. And this allows the agent to become incredibly

350
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:54,400
mind bogglingly complex without needing a massive energy guzzling brain to micromanage every single

351
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,800
twitch. So complexity isn't just about how many things you can do. It's about how many things

352
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,320
you can do without thinking about them. It's about how many layers of trusted automation you were

353
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,000
standing on top of at any given moment. You're standing on a pyramid of your own automated habits.

354
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But pyramids can crumble. And this is where the paper takes a darker, but I think even more fascinating

355
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,640
turn. This is section five. Robustness, breakdown and flexibility. Right. This is the,

356
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,280
so what happens when things go wrong section. And it starts by redefining robustness. We usually

357
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:33,200
think of a robust system as being like a tank. It's hard, it's armored, it's unbreakable. If a tank

358
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,600
hits a small wall, the wall breaks, the tank keeps going. But that's a very rigid, brittle definition of

359
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,840
robustness. The paper argues for a different view, which they call viability. So what's a viability?

360
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:53,600
Viability, or true robustness, isn't about never failing. It's not about executing action A perfectly

361
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,640
every time. It's about having action B, C, and D available in your back pocket for the moment when

362
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:08,960
action A inevitably fails. So it's the difference between a tank and maybe a tracer, a parkour athlete.

363
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,080
That's a great comparison. The tank has one primary mode of engagement. Drive forward, crush obstacle.

364
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,400
If the ground suddenly falls away into a deep chasm, the tank is finished. It has zero other options.

365
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:28,560
It's stuck. It's stuck. The parkour athlete is all about flexibility. If the wall is too high to climb,

366
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,920
they find a way to jump off another surface. If a ledge is slippery, they slide along it. If they fall,

367
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,120
they know how to roll to dissipate the impact. They have a rich and diverse space of affordances.

368
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,240
They have options. Exactly. The paper defines robustness as the ability to maintain a navigable

369
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:50,480
space of activity. As long as the set of possible actions, which they call TAT, is greater than zero,

370
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,960
as long as you have at least one move you can make, you are still in the game. You're viable.

371
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,360
And this leads to the most interesting part, the idea of breakdown. Usually we think of a breakdown

372
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:07,840
as the ultimate failure state. You know, the system crashed. But Fliction says a breakdown event is

373
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,720
actually informative. It's a source of information. Think back to your driving analogy. You're fluently

374
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,560
driving to work. You're thinking about your day, listening to the radio. You are on autopilot.

375
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:27,600
The drive to work composite affordance is active. It is. Then suddenly your car hits a patch of black

376
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,920
ice and begins to skid. Okay. The autopilot disengages instantly. All alarms go off. What

377
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:39,600
happens to your awareness? Where does your attention go? It zooms right in. Suddenly I am intensely aware

378
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,280
of the steering wheel in my hands. I can feel the vibration from the tires through the chassis. I'm

379
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:52,160
consciously pumping the brakes. I'm no longer driving to work. I am correcting a dangerous skid. You've put it

380
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,360
perfectly. The high level composite affordance of drive to work has collapsed. It's failed. And the

381
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,920
basic affordances, steer, brake, look, have rushed back to the surface of my consciousness. The

382
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,880
relegation of control has been undone. It's been undone. And the peeper's brilliant insight is that this

383
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:18,160
moment of breakdown proves the underlying complexity of the system. How so? Because if you were a truly

384
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,720
simple machine, like a toy car on a track, you would just crash. You wouldn't have any lower layers of

385
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,920
control to fall back on. The very fact that you can decompose the fluent action, you can fluidly shift

386
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:38,480
from driving to steering and braking, shows that all that complexity was there all along. It was just hidden

387
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,120
by your own fluency. So a system that breaks down gracefully and then reorganizes itself to cope with the

388
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:51,760
new situation is actually the height of complexity. It's the pinnacle. And this reorganization doesn't

389
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,240
have to be some high level intelligent plan. It can be what the paper calls morphological interaction.

390
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,040
You don't need a master plan to correct a skid. You just use your body. You turn into the skid.

391
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,680
You feel the physics of the situation. You sort of bump into the world in a different way until

392
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,640
stability returns. This feels like it connects directly to the philosophical part of the paper,

393
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,400
the intentional stance discussed in section six. It does. Because when my car is skidding on ice,

394
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm not really planning in a cool, detached way. I'm just reacting. But an outside observer would

395
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,080
absolutely say he is trying to regain control. They would assign a goal to my actions.

396
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:39,440
And that brings us to the big philosophical pivot. Can we legitimately say a system has a goal

397
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,600
or an intention, if it doesn't have a human-like brain, to consciously represent that goal?

398
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
This is the ghost in the machine question all over again, isn't it?

399
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,240
It is. And the paper handles it in a very pragmatic way by borrowing from the philosopher Daniel Dennett.

400
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,200
He proposed something called the intentional stance.

401
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,160
What's the stance?

402
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:06,000
It's a practical tool, not a metaphysical claim. It simply asks the question, is it explanatorily fruitful

403
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,280
to describe the system's behavior as if it has a goal?

404
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,480
So does it help us understand and predict what's going to happen next?

405
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,720
Exactly. Take a heat-seeking missile. Does it love heat? Does it desire to be near the jet engine?

406
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,960
Does it hate the cold emptiness of the sky?

407
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,000
No, of course not. It's just a bunch of sensors and circuitry.

408
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,640
Right. But if your job is to predict where that missile is going to go, it is incredibly useful

409
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,000
and efficient to say it wants to hit the hot target.

410
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,240
Because if I tried to predict its path by calculating the voltage across every wire inside it,

411
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,320
I'd be there for 100 years and the plane would already be gone. The goal is a predictive shortcut.

412
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,960
It's an explanatory filter. It filters out all the messy, low-level details of the mechanism,

413
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,400
allows us to focus on the coherent, organized structure of the behavior.

414
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,160
And the paper argues that for the purpose of measuring complexity,

415
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,520
we don't care if the agent really has a goal deep in its soul.

416
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,960
We just care if its behavior is structured as if it has a goal.

417
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,600
You got it.

418
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,240
And this is the move that allows us to finally compare a biological cell

419
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,800
and a sophisticated robot on the same terms.

420
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,880
Yes. A white blood cell that is chasing a bacterium through your bloodstream,

421
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,200
and a Roomba that is seeking its charging dock when its battery is low.

422
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,720
Neither of them has a brain in the human sense. Neither is thinking,

423
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,880
oh, I'm hungry for electricity.

424
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,920
But both of them exhibit what the paper calls behavioral complexity, or CBATT.

425
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,640
They behave in a stable, goal-directed way. They act as if they have intent.

426
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,200
And by adopting this stance, we can use the same language, and even the same math,

427
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,720
to describe the complexity of a living organism and an artificial one. We don't have to get bogged

428
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:02,320
down asking, but does it have a soul? We just ask, does its behavior have a direction?

429
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,920
It cleanly removes the metaphysics from the equation, which is absolutely essential if you

430
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,360
want to build a rigorous objective science of complexity.

431
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:16,560
This leads us to the final problem. And it's a very human problem. The problem of comparison.

432
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,360
We love a winner.

433
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,880
We love a winner. We need a leaderboard. We want to be able to rank things.

434
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,480
We want to know who is number one.

435
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,120
Exactly. I want to be able to say, humans are a hundred out of a hundred on the complexity scale.

436
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:31,760
Chimps are an 80. Spiders are a 10. My Roomba is a 2.

437
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,000
And the paper looks that desire and says, quite firmly, stop it. You can't do that. It's a

438
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,880
meaningless exercise. Why not? Why can't we just measure everyone's affordance landscape and see

439
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,080
who has the most? Because of a concept from mathematics called incomparability.

440
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,520
The paper uses the symbol of two parallel lines to represent this.

441
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,800
$8 key AT. Parallel A to an AT. That means the two agents are running on parallel tracks that never

442
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,800
intersect in a way that allows for a simple greater than or less than judgment.

443
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,440
It's the classic apples and oranges problem.

444
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,800
It's the submarine versus the skyscraper problem. Which one is better or more complex?

445
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,040
Well, it's a nonsensical question. The submarine is better at moving underwater,

446
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,080
and the skyscraper is better at staying still and being tall.

447
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:29,040
Exactly. Their activity spaces, their sets of affordances are almost completely disjoint.

448
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,800
One has affordances related to buoyancy and pressure. The other has affordances related

449
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,760
to structural load and wind shear. There's no universal neutral metric of complexity that you

450
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,200
can apply fairly to both. So you can only compare them locally?

451
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,880
You can only compare them locally. You can ask which is better at withstanding water pressure,

452
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,600
and the submarine wins. You can ask which can house more people, and the skyscraper wins.

453
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,880
But you can't ask which is globally more complex.

454
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,640
The question is mathematically meaningless within this framework,

455
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,640
and this leads to what the paper calls plurality and indeterminacy.

456
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,680
We just have to accept that there is no single peak on the mountain of evolution or design.

457
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,520
There are many, many different peaks.

458
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,960
That is surprisingly humble. It's a framework that intentionally takes humans off the pedestal.

459
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,600
We aren't the ultimate goal of evolution. We're just one possible type of complex system among many.

460
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:32,800
We're just one specific and in many ways very weird configuration of affordances.

461
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:39,360
A spider is another. A coral reef is another. A sophisticated AI running a global supply chain is

462
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:42,800
another. They are all valid. They are all real forms of complexity.

463
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,840
Okay, so let's try to bring this all home. Let's synthesize this. We started this journey with the

464
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:53,120
image of the clock and the reef. We did. We moved from the clean, deterministic,

465
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:59,600
mechanical view to the messy, relational, ecological view. We learned about synchronic complexity,

466
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,560
the radical idea that what matters is what you can do now, not how you learn to do it.

467
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,000
Then we learned about the affordance landscape, that complexity doesn't live inside your head.

468
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,120
It lives in the relationship between you and your world.

469
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:21,040
We saw how constraints, the power of no, are not limitations but are actually the secret ingredient

470
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,840
that structures behavior and makes complexity possible in the first place.

471
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,320
And we saw how relegation and automation are the engines that allow that complexity to scale up,

472
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,560
to build pyramids of habit so you don't get overwhelmed by the details.

473
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,720
And finally, we have to let go of our desire to rank everything on a single human-centric line.

474
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,280
We have to accept that complexity is plural.

475
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,800
Rich forms of agency need not be intelligent in order to be real.

476
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,800
I think that's the final powerful argument of the paper.

477
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,040
It really does change how I look at the world. I find myself looking for the brain

478
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,920
behind things less and less. Instead, I'm looking for the flow. I'm looking for the fit.

479
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,640
The coupling.

480
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,080
The coupling. When I see a bird effortlessly navigating a dense forest at high speed,

481
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,120
I'm no longer impressed by its abstract IQ. I'm just in awe of its perfect,

482
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,280
fluent coupling with the air, the branches, its own momentum.

483
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:24,880
It democratizes agency. It allows us to finally appreciate the genius of the mindless.

484
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,760
So I want to leave you, our listener, with a thought to chew on today. A bit of homework,

485
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,240
if you will.

486
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,640
Always good to send them off with a puzzle.

487
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,760
Think about your own day. We pride ourselves on our intelligence,

488
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,800
our conscious planning, our deliberate learning, our inner managerial brain.

489
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,360
But I want you to conduct an audit of your own complexity. How much of your day is actually spent

490
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,600
in that mode of thinking? And how much is spent in a state of fluency?

491
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:01,360
Exactly. Driving your car, typing on a keyboard, walking down a crowded street,

492
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,320
cooking a familiar meal, navigating the subtle cues of a conversation with a friend.

493
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,880
All the things you do without really doing them. Right. So here's the question. Are you actually

494
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,960
at your most complex, your most capable, when you are thinking the least? Is your autopilot

495
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,480
actually the most sophisticated, most impressive thing about you?

496
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,600
That is a very humbling thought to end on. Thanks for taking the deep dive. See you next time.
