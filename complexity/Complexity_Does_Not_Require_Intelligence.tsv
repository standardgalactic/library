0	7340	Welcome back to the deep dive. I want to start today with a mental image. It might sound a little
7340	12220	bit cliche at first, but just just stay with me on this. Okay, I'm with you. I want you to picture
12220	19160	the ultimate machine, the perfect clockwork universe. Right. Brass gears, intricate springs,
19260	25620	the whole thing. Endless brass gears. You can see them turning, springs coiling up, pistons firing
25620	31520	with, you know, perfect precision. It's engineered. It is completely deterministic. So if you know
31520	36560	where one gear is, you know where everything else is going to be. Exactly. And that image,
36740	44020	that clock has really been our dominant metaphor for, for how things work for what, 300 years? At
44020	50460	least since Newton, really. But now I want you to take that machine in your mind and I want you to
50460	56880	break it. Break it? How? Just melt it down. Watch the brass soften. The gears start to lose their
56880	62460	teeth. Watch them dissolve into something organic. Okay. And suddenly you're not looking at a machine
62460	68700	anymore. You're looking at a coral reef. Ah, okay. That's a massive shift in texture from cold metal
68700	74960	to, to life. Right. It's messy. It feels almost chaotic. You've got thousands of different species
74960	79640	interacting. They're eating. They're dying. They're growing on top of each other. It's a
79640	85560	teeming biological ecosystem. I'm with you. The clock and the reef. So here's the question that
85560	92900	really launches our whole investigation today. Which one of those two images, the perfect clock
92900	101300	or the messy reef, is actually more complex? Well, that's a trap of a question, isn't it? It is a bit
101300	107580	of a trap. Because historically, science and, you know, especially the field of artificial intelligence
107580	113960	would have pointed straight at the clock without hesitation. Why? Because we built it. Because we
113960	118780	can explain it. We love the clock because it's rational. It's reducible. We look at the reef and
118780	125020	we just see, well, chaos. We wave our hands and call it nature or instinct. Exactly. And it's that
125020	131180	bias, that deep-seated preference for the engineered over the organic that we are going to try and
131180	137540	dismantle today. It's a big project. It is. We're opening up a file that I genuinely think is going
137540	145300	to fundamentally change how you, the listener, look at intelligence and complexity. The paper is titled
145300	152900	Complexity Without Intelligence. It's by a researcher named Flixian, and it was just published January 24,
153200	160500	2026. And that title alone is, I mean, it's deliberately provocative. Complexity Without Intelligence.
160500	166840	It feels like an oxymoron, right? A contradiction in terms. We are just so trained to think that
166840	173820	smart equals complex. It's our default setting. If I show you a supercomputer that's, you know,
174020	178840	beating a grandmaster at chess, you're going to say, wow, that is a complex system. Of course.
179160	184540	But if I show you a common garden spider weaving this incredibly intricate, beautiful web,
184980	189780	you're probably going to say, well, that's just instinct. That's just biology doing its thing.
189780	195080	We dismiss it. We dismiss the spider. We assume that because the spider isn't consciously thinking
195080	201020	about, I don't know, the tensile strength of its own silk or calculating the geometric angles in its
201020	207020	head, that the activity itself must be simple. But Flixian is here to argue that we have this
207020	213840	completely fundamentally backward. The mission of this paper, and really our mission for this deep dive,
213840	219580	is to take a scalpel and surgically separate two ideas that have been glued together for decades.
219580	226860	And those two ideas are? What an agent knows so, its intelligence, its ability to learn, and what an
226860	233880	agent does, its complexity. And to really appreciate why that's such a heavy lift, you have to understand
233880	238500	the sheer amount of historical baggage we're all carrying. What do you mean?
238500	246140	Well, for the last 70 years or so, cognitive science, AI, philosophy of mind, they've all been
246140	249400	completely obsessed with the internal.
249660	250300	The brain.
250420	253200	The brain, the CPU, the little ghost in the machine.
253300	255640	We're always trying to peek inside the black box.
255720	261220	Precisely. We measure an agent's complexity by looking for evidence internal deliberation.
261220	267860	We look for planning. We look for reasoning. And most of all, we look for the ability to learn
267860	268540	new tricks.
269100	273460	And if a system can't learn, we basically write it off. We call it dumb or brittle.
273980	280380	We do. But this paper argues that this view is just incredibly narrow. It's like looking at the
280380	289760	world through a keyhole. It misses the staggering, mind-boggling complexity of systems that just work.
289760	291820	Systems that don't have to think about it.
292140	296580	Systems that function perfectly in the present moment, whether or not they have an inner life
296580	299940	or are consciously deliberating about their actions.
300100	305260	You mentioned before we started that we have this habit of ranking things, like some cosmic
305260	306660	leaderboard of existence.
306720	311180	Oh, we're obsessed with it. It's the great chain of being all over again. You've got humans at the
311180	313000	very top naturally.
313200	313740	Of course.
313900	318780	Then maybe chimps, then dogs, maybe dolphins if we're feeling generous. And then way,
318780	321160	way down to the bottom, you've got the insects and-
321160	322500	And the poor Roombas.
322600	323440	And the poor Roombas.
323780	331940	But the point is, we rank them based on one single criterion. How close are they to us?
332660	336300	How close do they come to mimicking human-style cognition?
336620	339680	That's what Fliction calls the deliberation bias, right?
339680	346440	We confuse the complexity of an action with the perceived effort of thinking really hard
346440	347340	about that action.
347840	354340	Okay. So the paper identifies this huge problem, this bias. What's the solution it offers? It
354340	356280	proposes a new framework.
356560	359040	It does. They call it an affordance-based account.
359280	364560	Right. Now, affordance is a word that gets thrown around a lot, you know, in user experience,
364560	370840	design, in psychology. But how is it being used here? It feels very specific.
371260	377860	It's very specific, and it signals a fundamental pivot. We are pivoting away from trying to count
377860	382500	how much RAM an agent has or how many neurons are in its frontal cortex.
382700	384580	But we're not looking inside the box anymore.
384700	387860	We're looking at the relationship between the agent and its environment.
387980	390620	The relationship. Okay. That feels like the key.
390620	396320	It is. The central claim here is that complexity isn't something you carry around inside your head
396320	401580	like a wallet. Complexity is something that happens between you and the world. It emerges
401580	402520	in the interaction.
402940	408040	Okay. I want to dig into that relationship a lot more. But first, let's establish the first
408040	412840	big pillar of the paper's argument, this concept of synchronic complexity.
413160	416860	Yes. This is the absolute foundation for everything else.
416860	423540	Synchronic? It sounds, I don't know, like a heavy metal band or maybe a fiercely technical
423540	425260	term from linguistics.
425460	430960	It actually does come from linguistics. From Saussure. He made this distinction. You have
430960	435920	diachronic linguistics, which is the study of how language changes over time. You know,
435980	437120	its history, its evolution.
437260	439600	Right. Like how Latin became French and Spanish.
439600	445720	Exactly. And then you have synchronic linguistics, which studies the language system as it exists
445720	450060	at one specific point in time. A snapshot. Frozen.
450920	457220	So when Fliction talks about synchronic complexity, they're asking us to take a snapshot and completely
457220	458260	ignore the history.
458500	459520	Completely and utterly.
459760	459980	Yeah.
460120	465220	Forget how the agent got to be the way it is. Forget if it evolved over millions of years
465220	470740	of natural selection. Forget if it was programmed by a genius five minutes ago. Forget if it learned
470740	473360	a skill through 10,000 hours of practice.
473480	474880	You're saying none of that matters.
475100	480160	For measuring synchronic complexity, no. We don't care. We are asking one simple question.
481080	487540	What can this agent do with rich, structured competence right now?
487540	494520	Okay. But that seems a little unfair to the learners, doesn't it? I mean, if I spent 10 years
494520	498520	of my life learning to play the piano and you build a robot that can just play it instantly,
498820	500980	don't I get some credit for all that effort?
501140	507020	Oh, absolutely. You get enormous credit for intelligence. You get credit for having a powerful
507020	513380	learning capacity. But the paper makes a very sharp distinction here. It argues you do not get
513380	516380	extra credit for the complexity of the performance itself.
516380	520620	So if the robot plays the concerto perfectly and I play it perfectly...
520620	527020	The complexity of the activity, the organized, goal-directed behavior, is identical in that
527020	527400	moment.
527600	532300	Ah, okay. I see the line they're drawing. It's really about separating the journey from the
532300	532860	destination.
533200	539180	Precisely. And they don't just state this, they formalize it. And I think it's worth just touching
539180	541860	on the logic, even if we skip the deep math.
541980	542560	Go for it.
542560	549560	They create two distinct variables. There's TCA, TT, T-day, which is the complexity of agent
549560	551380	A at a specific time T.
551380	556860	Right. C of A at time T. That T is doing a lot of work there, emphasizing the now.
557120	561520	It is. And then there's a completely separate variable, the learners, which stands for the
561520	565760	learning operator. That's the agent's ability to change its complexity over time.
565760	568080	So it's ability to get better or worse.
568080	576140	Exactly. And here's the paper's most radical claim. TAA, AT, and LRLers are independent variables.
576360	578400	They're not necessarily correlated.
578620	585080	Meaning, you can have an agent with incredibly high complexity, but basically zero ability
585080	585660	to learn.
585660	591800	Exactly. And conversely, you can have an agent with a massive capacity for learning, but very
591800	593560	low complexity in the present moment.
593780	596780	Give me an example of that second one. High learning, low complexity.
597080	603600	A human baby. An infant is arguably the most powerful learning machine on the planet. Its LRL value
603600	609560	is off the charts. It's just this incredible sponge for information and new skills.
609560	616920	But it's TAA. TAA. Its ability to actually do stuff right here, right now. It's pretty low. I mean,
616980	621400	it can barely hold its own head up. It can't navigate. It can't feed itself. Its present moment
621400	622560	complexity is minimal.
622960	625480	Okay. Versus the spider.
625920	632300	Versus the spider. The spider might have a learning operator that's close to zero. It's not going to
632300	638420	learn calculus. It probably won't even learn how to weave a fundamentally new style of web if you move
638420	645460	it to a different continent. It's fixed. It's largely fixed. But it's CA. The geometric precision
645460	652000	of the web. The material science of handling the silk. The vibration sensing it's performing right
652000	660080	this second to monitor for prey. That is astronomically high. So for decades, we've been judging the spider
660080	666740	for being stupid because its cellios is low, while completely ignoring that its city A-T-Feo is performing
666740	671060	a feat of engineering that our most advanced robots still struggle to replicate.
671300	676280	That's the internal bias again. We've been looking for the brain that learns and we've totally missed
676280	677940	the body that performs so beautifully.
678300	683680	This leads directly to the idea of fluency. And I have to admit, this is the part of the paper that
683680	686440	really flicked my entire perspective upside down.
686500	687420	I had the same reaction.
687660	692320	Because usually if I do something without thinking, I consider that, well, mindless. Like,
692320	696080	I'm on autopilot. And we usually use autopilot as a criticism.
696640	698720	You're just phoning it in. You're not really present.
699460	705440	Right. But Felines comes along and says that autopilot, or what they call fluency,
706080	709780	is actually a sign of higher complexity, not lower.
710040	715160	It's what I call the paradox of proficiency. The better you get at something, the less you think
715160	715560	about it.
715780	716840	Walk me through an example.
716840	722420	Okay. Think about a student who's learning a second language for the first time. Let's say
722420	726100	it's an American student in Paris trying to order a cup of coffee.
726340	728520	A universally high-stress situation.
729140	735360	Incredibly high-stress. Their brain is firing on all cylinders. They are consciously accessing
735360	741640	vocabulary, wrestling with grammar. They're translating every single word in their head.
741640	749060	Je voudrais un café. They are deliberating. They're using massive amounts of intelligence
749060	750620	and working memory.
750760	753100	They are thinking very, very hard.
753360	758500	Now, look at the Parisian locals standing in line next to them. They lean over and order
758500	763020	their coffee while simultaneously scrolling on their phone, maybe lighting a cigarette,
763480	765220	and dodging a person walking by.
765380	766780	They don't think about the French at all.
766780	772440	Not for a second. They are fluent. Now, who is exhibiting more complexity in that moment?
772820	778120	Well, my old intuition would say the student because their brain is working harder. But based
778120	779740	on this paper, it's the local.
779940	787040	It's the local by a landslide because the local can sustain multiple modes of activity at the same
787040	793480	time. They can engage in a social transaction, process information from their phone, perform a
793480	798860	motor task like lighting a cigarette, and navigate physical space all at once.
798960	804040	Whereas the student is completely consumed by the single task, they're paralyzed by it.
804040	807500	The student is brittle. The local is robust.
808200	813260	Brittle versus robust. That feels like a really key distinction. The student is brittle because
813260	819060	if the barista asks an unexpected follow-up question like, do you want sugar with that?
819060	821060	Their whole system crashes.
821520	826600	Exactly. They have to reboot the whole deliberation process. The local adapts instantly without even
826600	832220	breaking their stride. The paper's point is that deliberation, that process of stopping and thinking
832220	837000	is actually a cognitive bottleneck. It consumes precious resources.
837200	839180	So fluency frees up those resources.
839760	845640	It frees them up, which allows you to layer more activities on top. So in this framework,
845640	848260	not thinking, is a superpower.
848560	853700	It's the ultimate role of complexity, to push all the difficult stuff into the background so
853700	857240	you can interact with the world on a higher, more integrated level.
857280	857800	You've got it.
858100	863920	I want to pause on that term modes of activity for a second. The paper defines them as stable,
864540	872200	goal-explainable patterns of engagement. But isn't there a danger in defining complexity by
872200	874580	stability? I mean, a rock is very stable.
874580	876020	Ah, that's a fair challenge.
876140	880980	A rock has a very stable pattern of engagement with the ground. It just sits there. It's a rock
880980	881460	complex.
881880	887900	It's a valid pushback. But the key is in the second part of the definition. Goal-explainable
887900	894840	patterns of engagement. A rock isn't really engaging with the environment to solve a problem
894840	900360	related to its own viability. It's just being subjected to the laws of physics, like gravity.
900360	905980	It's passive. It's passive. The person ordering coffee is actively solving multiple viability
905980	911840	problems simultaneously. Social interaction, caffeine acquisition, information gathering,
912300	918240	nictine addiction, navigation. They are juggling multiple balls to maintain their state.
918760	920340	The rock isn't juggling anything.
920520	924600	Okay. So complexity is the number of balls you can keep in the air at once.
924760	927340	Without having to consciously look at any of them.
927340	932080	That's a fantastic way to put it. The more you can do without deliberation, the higher
932080	933460	your synchronic complexity.
933700	934180	Exactly.
934700	939840	Which brings us right back to that crucial relationship with the world. We've established
939840	945700	that we're looking at the now, and we're looking for fluent, layered activity. But where does
945700	951320	this flow actually happen? It happens in what the paper calls the affordance landscape.
951320	954860	The landscape of possibilities. It's the space you move through.
954860	960660	Let's switch the visual in our heads again. The clock is gone. The reef is gone. Now I want you
960660	967580	to picture a map. A massive, stylized subway map, like the London Underground map, with thousands
967580	969580	of lines diverging and converging.
969800	976320	That's a great image for it. That's the activity space. And each station, each potential stop
976320	977300	is an affordance.
977300	982220	Okay, so let's define affordance again, but really strictly in this relational sense, because
982220	988160	I think people, myself included, can get tripped up thinking an affordance is just a feature.
988540	991480	You know, my phone has the camera affordance.
991480	995440	Right, and that's not quite it. It's not a feature of the object, and it's not a skill
995440	1001660	of the user. It is the handshake between the two. The potential for a meaningful interaction.
1002020	1003540	The classic example is a chair.
1003540	1008380	Right. The classic example is a chair. Does a simple wooden chair have the affordance
1008380	1009280	of sitability?
1009840	1013060	Well, yes. Of course. That's what it's for.
1013240	1020160	For you, a human, yes. Your body has the right size, the right joint structure. The chair has
1020160	1025680	the right height, the right flat surface. The relationship works. The affordance of sitting
1025680	1027600	exists in that coupling.
1027940	1029020	But what if you're an elephant?
1029020	1034680	Then the chair is absolutely not for sitting. For an elephant, it might afford being smashed
1034680	1040220	or being a minor obstacle. But the sitting affordance does not exist for the elephant
1040220	1042100	chair coupling. It's gone.
1042460	1048260	The paper uses a slightly more terrifying example. The affordance of breathing.
1048540	1051600	Right. Let's look at the formula they use, just conceptually.
1052140	1057660	Four netters is the set of all affordances, all activities, available to you at time, $10.
1057660	1059320	My menu of options.
1059400	1065380	Your menu of options. Right now, sitting in this studio, the activity breathing is on
1065380	1070360	your menu. It's in your set four netters. You have lungs. That's the agent's contribution.
1070900	1076200	And the room has air. That's the environment's contribution. The relation holds.
1076560	1080280	But if you take me and drop me in the middle of the Pacific Ocean...
1080280	1084980	Your internal machinery hasn't changed one bit. You still have the same lungs. You're just
1084980	1089100	as smart. You have the same memories, the same capabilities you had a moment before.
1089300	1090700	But the environment has changed.
1090800	1095000	The environment has changed dramatically. The air is gone. The relation is broken. And
1095000	1099180	so the breathing affordance instantly vanishes from your set affordance.
1099600	1103680	And my overall complexity drops to zero pretty quickly after that.
1103860	1109920	Tragically so. But it proves the point with brutal clarity. Complexity isn't something you
1109920	1112580	just carry around inside your skin. It's relational.
1112580	1120240	So a supercomputer. A machine with more processing power than all of humanity combined. If you just
1120240	1122140	float it in the vacuum of space.
1122400	1129020	It has almost zero complexity. It has no inputs to process. No outputs to affect the world.
1129320	1132500	It can't do anything. It's just a warm, inert box.
1132500	1138240	This really dismantles those old brain-in-a-vat thought experiments, doesn't it? We used to think
1138240	1143740	if we could just perfectly simulate a brain, it would be conscious and complex all by itself.
1144080	1149540	And this framework, which is part of a broader movement called inactivism, says that's nonsense.
1150020	1156980	You are not a brain riding a body like a driver in a car. You are the entire coupled system of brain,
1157340	1159760	body, and world all acting together.
1159760	1165160	So if you take a simple organism, let's go back to our spider, and you put it in a really rich,
1165300	1170000	complex environment with lots of anchor points, wind currents, different kinds of prey.
1170200	1175580	Its activity space, its set of affordances just explodes. The spider in the rich environment
1175580	1177400	system becomes incredibly complex.
1177680	1182800	So this is the relational view. Complexity is what you can do with what you have, where you are.
1183040	1187760	It's not additive. You can't just keep adding more parts to the robot to make it more complex.
1187760	1191400	Yeah. You have to design the robot to better couple with its world.
1191620	1195200	Okay. And that coupling, that idea of the affordance landscape,
1195600	1199680	leads us to a really counterintuitive point. I think this is in section three.
1199880	1200980	Yes. Constraints.
1201200	1207580	Right. If complexity is about having options, about having a big, diverse menu of affordances,
1208280	1212820	then surely the goal is to have all the options. Infinite affordances.
1212820	1217220	I want to be able to fly and breathe underwater and see through walls.
1217420	1219240	I'd definitely take the flight option.
1219400	1225000	Me too. But the paper argues that infinite options wouldn't just be unhelpful,
1225200	1229780	they would actually destroy you. This is a section on constraints and the power of no.
1230200	1231740	It's one of my favorite parts of the paper.
1232020	1238540	So explain this to me. Why would no be powerful? Why is can't sometimes better than can?
1238540	1244980	It all comes down to the problem of information processing. Think about the concept of absence,
1245400	1251080	as the paper puts it. Some affordances are absent simply because they are physically impossible for
1251080	1258840	you. Like me trying to fly by flapping my arms. Exactly. That is a hard constraint imposed on you
1258840	1264600	by gravity and your own biology. Now you might see that as a limitation. A bummer.
1264600	1272540	It is a bummer. But the paper argues it's an incredible gift because constraint is prior to
1272540	1276660	choice. What does that mean prior to choice? It means that because that option is physically
1276660	1282380	impossible, your brain and your body do not have to waste a single calorie, a single millisecond,
1282540	1288460	even considering it. Yeah. The decision has been made for you by the universe. I see. So when I'm
1288460	1294520	standing at the edge of a cliff, I don't have this complex internal debate. Hmm. Should I flap my wings?
1294520	1299720	Today? Or should I take the stairs? The universe has already removed flap my wings from my menu.
1299860	1304720	It's already crossed it off for you. Now imagine if you could do anything. Imagine if every single
1304720	1311660	atom in this room was a valid handle for you to grab. Imagine if every direction was a valid path
1311660	1316620	for locomotion, including straight up. I'd be paralyzed. I wouldn't even know where to start.
1316680	1321620	It's overwhelming. We call that combinatorial explosion in computer science. If the number of
1321620	1327840	possibilities is nearly infinite, the time it would take to calculate the best one also becomes
1327840	1334500	infinite. You would just freeze, trapped by choice. So constraints act like, what, blinders on a horse?
1334680	1338940	That's a perfect analogy. They cut off all the peripheral noise and distraction,
1339340	1342640	so you can just move forward on the path that's actually available to you.
1342640	1347820	The paper talks about a relevance function here. It uses the Greek letter row.
1347980	1353760	Right. The relevance function one rowway is the great filter. In this mathematical model,
1354320	1360760	all the irrelevant or impossible activities, like you trying to fly or trying to walk through that
1360760	1367080	solid wall, they get a relevance score of zero. So they're filtered out before they even reach my
1367080	1372320	decision-making process. They never even enter the dynamics. This is what the paper calls the
1372320	1381120	economization of activity. By making 99.9% of all theoretical actions impossible, nature allows us
1381120	1387000	to become really, really good at the tiny fraction that is possible. I love the analogy of the musician
1387000	1392200	for this. I think it makes it really clear. Well, if you sit a musician down on a piano and say,
1392200	1398540	play any note that exists in the universe, they might just produce noise. It's too open. But if
1398540	1405360	you give them a key signature, say B-flat minor, you're imposing a constraint. You're limiting their
1405360	1413180	options. You're saying, don't play these six notes, only play these other ones. Yes. But that very
1413180	1419580	limitation is what creates the structure. Because they don't have to waste brainpower thinking about
1419580	1426000	all the wrong notes, they can now creatively and fluently explore the rich relationships between
1426000	1432340	all the right notes. The constraint enables the complexity. That is a perfect encapsulation of
1432340	1438200	the argument. Structure is just a positive-sounding word for constraint. You can't build a complex
1438200	1444440	skyscraper without rigid steel beams that limit where the floors and walls can go. Without those limits,
1444740	1448880	you don't have a building, you just have a pile of bricks. So, okay, let's recap where we are.
1448880	1452780	We have the now, which is synchronic. We have the relation, which is the affordance.
1452960	1456660	And we have the limit, which is the constraint. The three pillars so far.
1456940	1459700	But let's look at the structure of these activities themselves.
1460460	1464320	Section four of the paper is called structure, composition, and automation.
1464620	1469780	Right. Because your affordance landscape, your menu of options, isn't just a flat,
1470020	1474740	unorganized list. It's not a grocery list. Eat, sleep, walk, talk.
1474740	1481080	It has a hierarchy. Exactly. It has a hierarchy. The paper makes a distinction between basic
1481080	1486660	affordances and composite affordances. Okay. What's the difference? Basic affordances are the
1486660	1491900	sort of atomic units of action. They're the Lego bricks. Things like grasping an object with your
1491900	1498080	hand, focusing your eyes on a point, lifting a single foot. And composite affordances are the
1498080	1502820	complex structures you build out of those Lego bricks, like making a sandwich.
1502820	1507780	Making a sandwich is a perfect example. Or driving a car. You can't just drive a car
1507780	1513060	as a single action. You have to perform a whole sequence of basic affordances.
1513460	1518460	Turn the wheel, press the pedal, look in the mirror, move the shifter. You chain them together
1518460	1524260	in a stable pattern. But here's the crucial part, and it gets back to fluency. If I had to consciously
1524260	1530480	think about every single one of those basic affordances while making a sandwich, I'd starve to
1530480	1536960	death before I ever got to eat. Okay. Now I must grasp the knife. Now apply downward pressure.
1537520	1542640	Now slice the bread. Now stop slicing. It would take forever.
1542640	1548320	And this brings us to what might be the most important mechanism for complexity growth in
1548320	1551200	the entire paper. Relegation of control.
1551200	1555520	Relegation. It sounds like you're being demoted or sent away.
1555520	1560160	In this context, it's a huge promotion for the system's overall efficiency.
1560160	1566240	When a composite activity like driving or making a sandwich becomes stable and reliable through
1566240	1569920	practice, the agent stops consciously managing the details.
1569920	1574160	You stop thinking about turning the wheel and you start thinking about the goal, like going to the
1574160	1579120	store. Precisely. The low-level details get compressed and automated. They get chunked together.
1579120	1582640	The paper has a term for this, right? The projection operator.
1582640	1586640	Yes. The projection operator, which they denote with a dollar.
1587520	1594320	The math is a bit dense, but the concept is beautiful. Imagine taking a thousand tiny distinct
1594320	1599440	gods that represent your basic actions and then drawing a big circle around them and giving that
1599440	1603920	whole collection a single simple label. One thing.
1603920	1609120	So turn wheel, press gas, check mirror becomes drive.
1609120	1612400	It gets projected onto a simpler higher level description.
1613280	1618800	You now treat that complex chain of actions as if it were a single basic unit. This is the
1618800	1620320	automation we were talking about earlier.
1620320	1625040	And this solves the manager problem, the homunculus fallacy. Tell me more about that.
1625040	1631520	Well, there's this old sort of fallacy in AI and cognitive science that for a system to be
1631520	1636880	coordinated, you need a central executive or a manager in the brain that's supervising everything,
1636880	1641120	a little man in the head pulling all the levers. And this model says you don't need that little
1641120	1647040	man. Right. If the system can automate its own subroutines, if the legs can just handle the walking
1647040	1651760	so the brain doesn't have to, you don't need a manager for the legs. You relegate control.
1651760	1659520	You relegate the control down to the limbs themselves or to the spinal cord or to the
1659520	1665840	cerebellum, to these subconscious embodied habits. And this allows the agent to become incredibly
1666480	1674400	mind bogglingly complex without needing a massive energy guzzling brain to micromanage every single
1674400	1678800	twitch. So complexity isn't just about how many things you can do. It's about how many things
1678800	1684320	you can do without thinking about them. It's about how many layers of trusted automation you were
1684320	1690000	standing on top of at any given moment. You're standing on a pyramid of your own automated habits.
1690000	1696000	But pyramids can crumble. And this is where the paper takes a darker, but I think even more fascinating
1696720	1702640	turn. This is section five. Robustness, breakdown and flexibility. Right. This is the,
1702640	1707280	so what happens when things go wrong section. And it starts by redefining robustness. We usually
1707280	1713200	think of a robust system as being like a tank. It's hard, it's armored, it's unbreakable. If a tank
1713200	1719600	hits a small wall, the wall breaks, the tank keeps going. But that's a very rigid, brittle definition of
1719600	1725840	robustness. The paper argues for a different view, which they call viability. So what's a viability?
1725840	1733600	Viability, or true robustness, isn't about never failing. It's not about executing action A perfectly
1733600	1740640	every time. It's about having action B, C, and D available in your back pocket for the moment when
1740640	1748960	action A inevitably fails. So it's the difference between a tank and maybe a tracer, a parkour athlete.
1748960	1756080	That's a great comparison. The tank has one primary mode of engagement. Drive forward, crush obstacle.
1756080	1762400	If the ground suddenly falls away into a deep chasm, the tank is finished. It has zero other options.
1762400	1768560	It's stuck. It's stuck. The parkour athlete is all about flexibility. If the wall is too high to climb,
1768560	1773920	they find a way to jump off another surface. If a ledge is slippery, they slide along it. If they fall,
1773920	1779120	they know how to roll to dissipate the impact. They have a rich and diverse space of affordances.
1779120	1784240	They have options. Exactly. The paper defines robustness as the ability to maintain a navigable
1784240	1790480	space of activity. As long as the set of possible actions, which they call TAT, is greater than zero,
1790480	1794960	as long as you have at least one move you can make, you are still in the game. You're viable.
1794960	1801360	And this leads to the most interesting part, the idea of breakdown. Usually we think of a breakdown
1801360	1807840	as the ultimate failure state. You know, the system crashed. But Fliction says a breakdown event is
1807840	1814720	actually informative. It's a source of information. Think back to your driving analogy. You're fluently
1814720	1820560	driving to work. You're thinking about your day, listening to the radio. You are on autopilot.
1820560	1827600	The drive to work composite affordance is active. It is. Then suddenly your car hits a patch of black
1827600	1833920	ice and begins to skid. Okay. The autopilot disengages instantly. All alarms go off. What
1833920	1839600	happens to your awareness? Where does your attention go? It zooms right in. Suddenly I am intensely aware
1839600	1845280	of the steering wheel in my hands. I can feel the vibration from the tires through the chassis. I'm
1845280	1852160	consciously pumping the brakes. I'm no longer driving to work. I am correcting a dangerous skid. You've put it
1852160	1857360	perfectly. The high level composite affordance of drive to work has collapsed. It's failed. And the
1857360	1863920	basic affordances, steer, brake, look, have rushed back to the surface of my consciousness. The
1863920	1870880	relegation of control has been undone. It's been undone. And the peeper's brilliant insight is that this
1870880	1878160	moment of breakdown proves the underlying complexity of the system. How so? Because if you were a truly
1878160	1884720	simple machine, like a toy car on a track, you would just crash. You wouldn't have any lower layers of
1884720	1891920	control to fall back on. The very fact that you can decompose the fluent action, you can fluidly shift
1891920	1898480	from driving to steering and braking, shows that all that complexity was there all along. It was just hidden
1898480	1905120	by your own fluency. So a system that breaks down gracefully and then reorganizes itself to cope with the
1905120	1911760	new situation is actually the height of complexity. It's the pinnacle. And this reorganization doesn't
1911760	1918240	have to be some high level intelligent plan. It can be what the paper calls morphological interaction.
1918240	1923040	You don't need a master plan to correct a skid. You just use your body. You turn into the skid.
1923040	1927680	You feel the physics of the situation. You sort of bump into the world in a different way until
1927680	1932640	stability returns. This feels like it connects directly to the philosophical part of the paper,
1932640	1938400	the intentional stance discussed in section six. It does. Because when my car is skidding on ice,
1938400	1945200	I'm not really planning in a cool, detached way. I'm just reacting. But an outside observer would
1945200	1950080	absolutely say he is trying to regain control. They would assign a goal to my actions.
1950080	1959440	And that brings us to the big philosophical pivot. Can we legitimately say a system has a goal
1959440	1965600	or an intention, if it doesn't have a human-like brain, to consciously represent that goal?
1965600	1968320	This is the ghost in the machine question all over again, isn't it?
1968320	1974240	It is. And the paper handles it in a very pragmatic way by borrowing from the philosopher Daniel Dennett.
1974240	1977200	He proposed something called the intentional stance.
1977200	1978160	What's the stance?
1978160	1986000	It's a practical tool, not a metaphysical claim. It simply asks the question, is it explanatorily fruitful
1986000	1989280	to describe the system's behavior as if it has a goal?
1989280	1992480	So does it help us understand and predict what's going to happen next?
1992480	1998720	Exactly. Take a heat-seeking missile. Does it love heat? Does it desire to be near the jet engine?
1998720	2000960	Does it hate the cold emptiness of the sky?
2000960	2004000	No, of course not. It's just a bunch of sensors and circuitry.
2004000	2010640	Right. But if your job is to predict where that missile is going to go, it is incredibly useful
2010640	2014000	and efficient to say it wants to hit the hot target.
2014000	2020240	Because if I tried to predict its path by calculating the voltage across every wire inside it,
2020240	2026320	I'd be there for 100 years and the plane would already be gone. The goal is a predictive shortcut.
2026320	2032960	It's an explanatory filter. It filters out all the messy, low-level details of the mechanism,
2032960	2038400	allows us to focus on the coherent, organized structure of the behavior.
2038400	2042160	And the paper argues that for the purpose of measuring complexity,
2042160	2045520	we don't care if the agent really has a goal deep in its soul.
2045520	2048960	We just care if its behavior is structured as if it has a goal.
2048960	2049600	You got it.
2049600	2054240	And this is the move that allows us to finally compare a biological cell
2054240	2056800	and a sophisticated robot on the same terms.
2056800	2062880	Yes. A white blood cell that is chasing a bacterium through your bloodstream,
2062880	2067200	and a Roomba that is seeking its charging dock when its battery is low.
2067200	2070720	Neither of them has a brain in the human sense. Neither is thinking,
2070720	2072880	oh, I'm hungry for electricity.
2072880	2079920	But both of them exhibit what the paper calls behavioral complexity, or CBATT.
2079920	2086640	They behave in a stable, goal-directed way. They act as if they have intent.
2086640	2091200	And by adopting this stance, we can use the same language, and even the same math,
2091200	2096720	to describe the complexity of a living organism and an artificial one. We don't have to get bogged
2096720	2102320	down asking, but does it have a soul? We just ask, does its behavior have a direction?
2102320	2107920	It cleanly removes the metaphysics from the equation, which is absolutely essential if you
2107920	2111360	want to build a rigorous objective science of complexity.
2111360	2116560	This leads us to the final problem. And it's a very human problem. The problem of comparison.
2116560	2117360	We love a winner.
2117360	2120880	We love a winner. We need a leaderboard. We want to be able to rank things.
2120880	2122480	We want to know who is number one.
2122480	2127120	Exactly. I want to be able to say, humans are a hundred out of a hundred on the complexity scale.
2127600	2131760	Chimps are an 80. Spiders are a 10. My Roomba is a 2.
2132320	2138000	And the paper looks that desire and says, quite firmly, stop it. You can't do that. It's a
2138000	2142880	meaningless exercise. Why not? Why can't we just measure everyone's affordance landscape and see
2142880	2148080	who has the most? Because of a concept from mathematics called incomparability.
2149200	2153520	The paper uses the symbol of two parallel lines to represent this.
2153520	2160800	$8 key AT. Parallel A to an AT. That means the two agents are running on parallel tracks that never
2160800	2166800	intersect in a way that allows for a simple greater than or less than judgment.
2166800	2169440	It's the classic apples and oranges problem.
2169440	2174800	It's the submarine versus the skyscraper problem. Which one is better or more complex?
2174800	2179040	Well, it's a nonsensical question. The submarine is better at moving underwater,
2179040	2182080	and the skyscraper is better at staying still and being tall.
2182080	2189040	Exactly. Their activity spaces, their sets of affordances are almost completely disjoint.
2189760	2194800	One has affordances related to buoyancy and pressure. The other has affordances related
2194800	2201760	to structural load and wind shear. There's no universal neutral metric of complexity that you
2201760	2205200	can apply fairly to both. So you can only compare them locally?
2205200	2208880	You can only compare them locally. You can ask which is better at withstanding water pressure,
2208880	2213600	and the submarine wins. You can ask which can house more people, and the skyscraper wins.
2213600	2216880	But you can't ask which is globally more complex.
2216880	2220640	The question is mathematically meaningless within this framework,
2220640	2224640	and this leads to what the paper calls plurality and indeterminacy.
2226000	2231680	We just have to accept that there is no single peak on the mountain of evolution or design.
2231680	2233520	There are many, many different peaks.
2233520	2240960	That is surprisingly humble. It's a framework that intentionally takes humans off the pedestal.
2240960	2247600	We aren't the ultimate goal of evolution. We're just one possible type of complex system among many.
2247600	2252800	We're just one specific and in many ways very weird configuration of affordances.
2252800	2259360	A spider is another. A coral reef is another. A sophisticated AI running a global supply chain is
2259360	2262800	another. They are all valid. They are all real forms of complexity.
2262800	2267840	Okay, so let's try to bring this all home. Let's synthesize this. We started this journey with the
2267840	2273120	image of the clock and the reef. We did. We moved from the clean, deterministic,
2273120	2279600	mechanical view to the messy, relational, ecological view. We learned about synchronic complexity,
2279600	2284560	the radical idea that what matters is what you can do now, not how you learn to do it.
2284560	2290000	Then we learned about the affordance landscape, that complexity doesn't live inside your head.
2290000	2293120	It lives in the relationship between you and your world.
2293120	2301040	We saw how constraints, the power of no, are not limitations but are actually the secret ingredient
2301040	2305840	that structures behavior and makes complexity possible in the first place.
2305840	2312320	And we saw how relegation and automation are the engines that allow that complexity to scale up,
2312320	2316560	to build pyramids of habit so you don't get overwhelmed by the details.
2316560	2322720	And finally, we have to let go of our desire to rank everything on a single human-centric line.
2322720	2325280	We have to accept that complexity is plural.
2325280	2328800	Rich forms of agency need not be intelligent in order to be real.
2329760	2332800	I think that's the final powerful argument of the paper.
2332800	2337040	It really does change how I look at the world. I find myself looking for the brain
2337040	2341920	behind things less and less. Instead, I'm looking for the flow. I'm looking for the fit.
2341920	2342640	The coupling.
2342640	2348080	The coupling. When I see a bird effortlessly navigating a dense forest at high speed,
2348080	2353120	I'm no longer impressed by its abstract IQ. I'm just in awe of its perfect,
2353120	2357280	fluent coupling with the air, the branches, its own momentum.
2357280	2364880	It democratizes agency. It allows us to finally appreciate the genius of the mindless.
2364880	2371760	So I want to leave you, our listener, with a thought to chew on today. A bit of homework,
2371760	2372240	if you will.
2372240	2374640	Always good to send them off with a puzzle.
2374640	2379760	Think about your own day. We pride ourselves on our intelligence,
2379760	2384800	our conscious planning, our deliberate learning, our inner managerial brain.
2386000	2391360	But I want you to conduct an audit of your own complexity. How much of your day is actually spent
2391360	2395600	in that mode of thinking? And how much is spent in a state of fluency?
2395600	2401360	Exactly. Driving your car, typing on a keyboard, walking down a crowded street,
2401360	2406320	cooking a familiar meal, navigating the subtle cues of a conversation with a friend.
2406320	2410880	All the things you do without really doing them. Right. So here's the question. Are you actually
2410880	2416960	at your most complex, your most capable, when you are thinking the least? Is your autopilot
2416960	2420480	actually the most sophisticated, most impressive thing about you?
2420480	2427600	That is a very humbling thought to end on. Thanks for taking the deep dive. See you next time.
