00:00.000 --> 00:07.340
Welcome back to the deep dive. I want to start today with a mental image. It might sound a little

00:07.340 --> 00:12.220
bit cliche at first, but just just stay with me on this. Okay, I'm with you. I want you to picture

00:12.220 --> 00:19.160
the ultimate machine, the perfect clockwork universe. Right. Brass gears, intricate springs,

00:19.260 --> 00:25.620
the whole thing. Endless brass gears. You can see them turning, springs coiling up, pistons firing

00:25.620 --> 00:31.520
with, you know, perfect precision. It's engineered. It is completely deterministic. So if you know

00:31.520 --> 00:36.560
where one gear is, you know where everything else is going to be. Exactly. And that image,

00:36.740 --> 00:44.020
that clock has really been our dominant metaphor for, for how things work for what, 300 years? At

00:44.020 --> 00:50.460
least since Newton, really. But now I want you to take that machine in your mind and I want you to

00:50.460 --> 00:56.880
break it. Break it? How? Just melt it down. Watch the brass soften. The gears start to lose their

00:56.880 --> 01:02.460
teeth. Watch them dissolve into something organic. Okay. And suddenly you're not looking at a machine

01:02.460 --> 01:08.700
anymore. You're looking at a coral reef. Ah, okay. That's a massive shift in texture from cold metal

01:08.700 --> 01:14.960
to, to life. Right. It's messy. It feels almost chaotic. You've got thousands of different species

01:14.960 --> 01:19.640
interacting. They're eating. They're dying. They're growing on top of each other. It's a

01:19.640 --> 01:25.560
teeming biological ecosystem. I'm with you. The clock and the reef. So here's the question that

01:25.560 --> 01:32.900
really launches our whole investigation today. Which one of those two images, the perfect clock

01:32.900 --> 01:41.300
or the messy reef, is actually more complex? Well, that's a trap of a question, isn't it? It is a bit

01:41.300 --> 01:47.580
of a trap. Because historically, science and, you know, especially the field of artificial intelligence

01:47.580 --> 01:53.960
would have pointed straight at the clock without hesitation. Why? Because we built it. Because we

01:53.960 --> 01:58.780
can explain it. We love the clock because it's rational. It's reducible. We look at the reef and

01:58.780 --> 02:05.020
we just see, well, chaos. We wave our hands and call it nature or instinct. Exactly. And it's that

02:05.020 --> 02:11.180
bias, that deep-seated preference for the engineered over the organic that we are going to try and

02:11.180 --> 02:17.540
dismantle today. It's a big project. It is. We're opening up a file that I genuinely think is going

02:17.540 --> 02:25.300
to fundamentally change how you, the listener, look at intelligence and complexity. The paper is titled

02:25.300 --> 02:32.900
Complexity Without Intelligence. It's by a researcher named Flixian, and it was just published January 24,

02:33.200 --> 02:40.500
2026. And that title alone is, I mean, it's deliberately provocative. Complexity Without Intelligence.

02:40.500 --> 02:46.840
It feels like an oxymoron, right? A contradiction in terms. We are just so trained to think that

02:46.840 --> 02:53.820
smart equals complex. It's our default setting. If I show you a supercomputer that's, you know,

02:54.020 --> 02:58.840
beating a grandmaster at chess, you're going to say, wow, that is a complex system. Of course.

02:59.160 --> 03:04.540
But if I show you a common garden spider weaving this incredibly intricate, beautiful web,

03:04.980 --> 03:09.780
you're probably going to say, well, that's just instinct. That's just biology doing its thing.

03:09.780 --> 03:15.080
We dismiss it. We dismiss the spider. We assume that because the spider isn't consciously thinking

03:15.080 --> 03:21.020
about, I don't know, the tensile strength of its own silk or calculating the geometric angles in its

03:21.020 --> 03:27.020
head, that the activity itself must be simple. But Flixian is here to argue that we have this

03:27.020 --> 03:33.840
completely fundamentally backward. The mission of this paper, and really our mission for this deep dive,

03:33.840 --> 03:39.580
is to take a scalpel and surgically separate two ideas that have been glued together for decades.

03:39.580 --> 03:46.860
And those two ideas are? What an agent knows so, its intelligence, its ability to learn, and what an

03:46.860 --> 03:53.880
agent does, its complexity. And to really appreciate why that's such a heavy lift, you have to understand

03:53.880 --> 03:58.500
the sheer amount of historical baggage we're all carrying. What do you mean?

03:58.500 --> 04:06.140
Well, for the last 70 years or so, cognitive science, AI, philosophy of mind, they've all been

04:06.140 --> 04:09.400
completely obsessed with the internal.

04:09.660 --> 04:10.300
The brain.

04:10.420 --> 04:13.200
The brain, the CPU, the little ghost in the machine.

04:13.300 --> 04:15.640
We're always trying to peek inside the black box.

04:15.720 --> 04:21.220
Precisely. We measure an agent's complexity by looking for evidence internal deliberation.

04:21.220 --> 04:27.860
We look for planning. We look for reasoning. And most of all, we look for the ability to learn

04:27.860 --> 04:28.540
new tricks.

04:29.100 --> 04:33.460
And if a system can't learn, we basically write it off. We call it dumb or brittle.

04:33.980 --> 04:40.380
We do. But this paper argues that this view is just incredibly narrow. It's like looking at the

04:40.380 --> 04:49.760
world through a keyhole. It misses the staggering, mind-boggling complexity of systems that just work.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.820
Systems that don't have to think about it.

04:52.140 --> 04:56.580
Systems that function perfectly in the present moment, whether or not they have an inner life

04:56.580 --> 04:59.940
or are consciously deliberating about their actions.

05:00.100 --> 05:05.260
You mentioned before we started that we have this habit of ranking things, like some cosmic

05:05.260 --> 05:06.660
leaderboard of existence.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.180
Oh, we're obsessed with it. It's the great chain of being all over again. You've got humans at the

05:11.180 --> 05:13.000
very top naturally.

05:13.200 --> 05:13.740
Of course.

05:13.900 --> 05:18.780
Then maybe chimps, then dogs, maybe dolphins if we're feeling generous. And then way,

05:18.780 --> 05:21.160
way down to the bottom, you've got the insects and-

05:21.160 --> 05:22.500
And the poor Roombas.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.440
And the poor Roombas.

05:23.780 --> 05:31.940
But the point is, we rank them based on one single criterion. How close are they to us?

05:32.660 --> 05:36.300
How close do they come to mimicking human-style cognition?

05:36.620 --> 05:39.680
That's what Fliction calls the deliberation bias, right?

05:39.680 --> 05:46.440
We confuse the complexity of an action with the perceived effort of thinking really hard

05:46.440 --> 05:47.340
about that action.

05:47.840 --> 05:54.340
Okay. So the paper identifies this huge problem, this bias. What's the solution it offers? It

05:54.340 --> 05:56.280
proposes a new framework.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.040
It does. They call it an affordance-based account.

05:59.280 --> 06:04.560
Right. Now, affordance is a word that gets thrown around a lot, you know, in user experience,

06:04.560 --> 06:10.840
design, in psychology. But how is it being used here? It feels very specific.

06:11.260 --> 06:17.860
It's very specific, and it signals a fundamental pivot. We are pivoting away from trying to count

06:17.860 --> 06:22.500
how much RAM an agent has or how many neurons are in its frontal cortex.

06:22.700 --> 06:24.580
But we're not looking inside the box anymore.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.860
We're looking at the relationship between the agent and its environment.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.620
The relationship. Okay. That feels like the key.

06:30.620 --> 06:36.320
It is. The central claim here is that complexity isn't something you carry around inside your head

06:36.320 --> 06:41.580
like a wallet. Complexity is something that happens between you and the world. It emerges

06:41.580 --> 06:42.520
in the interaction.

06:42.940 --> 06:48.040
Okay. I want to dig into that relationship a lot more. But first, let's establish the first

06:48.040 --> 06:52.840
big pillar of the paper's argument, this concept of synchronic complexity.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.860
Yes. This is the absolute foundation for everything else.

06:56.860 --> 07:03.540
Synchronic? It sounds, I don't know, like a heavy metal band or maybe a fiercely technical

07:03.540 --> 07:05.260
term from linguistics.

07:05.460 --> 07:10.960
It actually does come from linguistics. From Saussure. He made this distinction. You have

07:10.960 --> 07:15.920
diachronic linguistics, which is the study of how language changes over time. You know,

07:15.980 --> 07:17.120
its history, its evolution.

07:17.260 --> 07:19.600
Right. Like how Latin became French and Spanish.

07:19.600 --> 07:25.720
Exactly. And then you have synchronic linguistics, which studies the language system as it exists

07:25.720 --> 07:30.060
at one specific point in time. A snapshot. Frozen.

07:30.920 --> 07:37.220
So when Fliction talks about synchronic complexity, they're asking us to take a snapshot and completely

07:37.220 --> 07:38.260
ignore the history.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.520
Completely and utterly.

07:39.760 --> 07:39.980
Yeah.

07:40.120 --> 07:45.220
Forget how the agent got to be the way it is. Forget if it evolved over millions of years

07:45.220 --> 07:50.740
of natural selection. Forget if it was programmed by a genius five minutes ago. Forget if it learned

07:50.740 --> 07:53.360
a skill through 10,000 hours of practice.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.880
You're saying none of that matters.

07:55.100 --> 08:00.160
For measuring synchronic complexity, no. We don't care. We are asking one simple question.

08:01.080 --> 08:07.540
What can this agent do with rich, structured competence right now?

08:07.540 --> 08:14.520
Okay. But that seems a little unfair to the learners, doesn't it? I mean, if I spent 10 years

08:14.520 --> 08:18.520
of my life learning to play the piano and you build a robot that can just play it instantly,

08:18.820 --> 08:20.980
don't I get some credit for all that effort?

08:21.140 --> 08:27.020
Oh, absolutely. You get enormous credit for intelligence. You get credit for having a powerful

08:27.020 --> 08:33.380
learning capacity. But the paper makes a very sharp distinction here. It argues you do not get

08:33.380 --> 08:36.380
extra credit for the complexity of the performance itself.

08:36.380 --> 08:40.620
So if the robot plays the concerto perfectly and I play it perfectly...

08:40.620 --> 08:47.020
The complexity of the activity, the organized, goal-directed behavior, is identical in that

08:47.020 --> 08:47.400
moment.

08:47.600 --> 08:52.300
Ah, okay. I see the line they're drawing. It's really about separating the journey from the

08:52.300 --> 08:52.860
destination.

08:53.200 --> 08:59.180
Precisely. And they don't just state this, they formalize it. And I think it's worth just touching

08:59.180 --> 09:01.860
on the logic, even if we skip the deep math.

09:01.980 --> 09:02.560
Go for it.

09:02.560 --> 09:09.560
They create two distinct variables. There's TCA, TT, T-day, which is the complexity of agent

09:09.560 --> 09:11.380
A at a specific time T.

09:11.380 --> 09:16.860
Right. C of A at time T. That T is doing a lot of work there, emphasizing the now.

09:17.120 --> 09:21.520
It is. And then there's a completely separate variable, the learners, which stands for the

09:21.520 --> 09:25.760
learning operator. That's the agent's ability to change its complexity over time.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.080
So it's ability to get better or worse.

09:28.080 --> 09:36.140
Exactly. And here's the paper's most radical claim. TAA, AT, and LRLers are independent variables.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.400
They're not necessarily correlated.

09:38.620 --> 09:45.080
Meaning, you can have an agent with incredibly high complexity, but basically zero ability

09:45.080 --> 09:45.660
to learn.

09:45.660 --> 09:51.800
Exactly. And conversely, you can have an agent with a massive capacity for learning, but very

09:51.800 --> 09:53.560
low complexity in the present moment.

09:53.780 --> 09:56.780
Give me an example of that second one. High learning, low complexity.

09:57.080 --> 10:03.600
A human baby. An infant is arguably the most powerful learning machine on the planet. Its LRL value

10:03.600 --> 10:09.560
is off the charts. It's just this incredible sponge for information and new skills.

10:09.560 --> 10:16.920
But it's TAA. TAA. Its ability to actually do stuff right here, right now. It's pretty low. I mean,

10:16.980 --> 10:21.400
it can barely hold its own head up. It can't navigate. It can't feed itself. Its present moment

10:21.400 --> 10:22.560
complexity is minimal.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.480
Okay. Versus the spider.

10:25.920 --> 10:32.300
Versus the spider. The spider might have a learning operator that's close to zero. It's not going to

10:32.300 --> 10:38.420
learn calculus. It probably won't even learn how to weave a fundamentally new style of web if you move

10:38.420 --> 10:45.460
it to a different continent. It's fixed. It's largely fixed. But it's CA. The geometric precision

10:45.460 --> 10:52.000
of the web. The material science of handling the silk. The vibration sensing it's performing right

10:52.000 --> 11:00.080
this second to monitor for prey. That is astronomically high. So for decades, we've been judging the spider

11:00.080 --> 11:06.740
for being stupid because its cellios is low, while completely ignoring that its city A-T-Feo is performing

11:06.740 --> 11:11.060
a feat of engineering that our most advanced robots still struggle to replicate.

11:11.300 --> 11:16.280
That's the internal bias again. We've been looking for the brain that learns and we've totally missed

11:16.280 --> 11:17.940
the body that performs so beautifully.

11:18.300 --> 11:23.680
This leads directly to the idea of fluency. And I have to admit, this is the part of the paper that

11:23.680 --> 11:26.440
really flicked my entire perspective upside down.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.420
I had the same reaction.

11:27.660 --> 11:32.320
Because usually if I do something without thinking, I consider that, well, mindless. Like,

11:32.320 --> 11:36.080
I'm on autopilot. And we usually use autopilot as a criticism.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.720
You're just phoning it in. You're not really present.

11:39.460 --> 11:45.440
Right. But Felines comes along and says that autopilot, or what they call fluency,

11:46.080 --> 11:49.780
is actually a sign of higher complexity, not lower.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.160
It's what I call the paradox of proficiency. The better you get at something, the less you think

11:55.160 --> 11:55.560
about it.

11:55.780 --> 11:56.840
Walk me through an example.

11:56.840 --> 12:02.420
Okay. Think about a student who's learning a second language for the first time. Let's say

12:02.420 --> 12:06.100
it's an American student in Paris trying to order a cup of coffee.

12:06.340 --> 12:08.520
A universally high-stress situation.

12:09.140 --> 12:15.360
Incredibly high-stress. Their brain is firing on all cylinders. They are consciously accessing

12:15.360 --> 12:21.640
vocabulary, wrestling with grammar. They're translating every single word in their head.

12:21.640 --> 12:29.060
Je voudrais un café. They are deliberating. They're using massive amounts of intelligence

12:29.060 --> 12:30.620
and working memory.

12:30.760 --> 12:33.100
They are thinking very, very hard.

12:33.360 --> 12:38.500
Now, look at the Parisian locals standing in line next to them. They lean over and order

12:38.500 --> 12:43.020
their coffee while simultaneously scrolling on their phone, maybe lighting a cigarette,

12:43.480 --> 12:45.220
and dodging a person walking by.

12:45.380 --> 12:46.780
They don't think about the French at all.

12:46.780 --> 12:52.440
Not for a second. They are fluent. Now, who is exhibiting more complexity in that moment?

12:52.820 --> 12:58.120
Well, my old intuition would say the student because their brain is working harder. But based

12:58.120 --> 12:59.740
on this paper, it's the local.

12:59.940 --> 13:07.040
It's the local by a landslide because the local can sustain multiple modes of activity at the same

13:07.040 --> 13:13.480
time. They can engage in a social transaction, process information from their phone, perform a

13:13.480 --> 13:18.860
motor task like lighting a cigarette, and navigate physical space all at once.

13:18.960 --> 13:24.040
Whereas the student is completely consumed by the single task, they're paralyzed by it.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.500
The student is brittle. The local is robust.

13:28.200 --> 13:33.260
Brittle versus robust. That feels like a really key distinction. The student is brittle because

13:33.260 --> 13:39.060
if the barista asks an unexpected follow-up question like, do you want sugar with that?

13:39.060 --> 13:41.060
Their whole system crashes.

13:41.520 --> 13:46.600
Exactly. They have to reboot the whole deliberation process. The local adapts instantly without even

13:46.600 --> 13:52.220
breaking their stride. The paper's point is that deliberation, that process of stopping and thinking

13:52.220 --> 13:57.000
is actually a cognitive bottleneck. It consumes precious resources.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.180
So fluency frees up those resources.

13:59.760 --> 14:05.640
It frees them up, which allows you to layer more activities on top. So in this framework,

14:05.640 --> 14:08.260
not thinking, is a superpower.

14:08.560 --> 14:13.700
It's the ultimate role of complexity, to push all the difficult stuff into the background so

14:13.700 --> 14:17.240
you can interact with the world on a higher, more integrated level.

14:17.280 --> 14:17.800
You've got it.

14:18.100 --> 14:23.920
I want to pause on that term modes of activity for a second. The paper defines them as stable,

14:24.540 --> 14:32.200
goal-explainable patterns of engagement. But isn't there a danger in defining complexity by

14:32.200 --> 14:34.580
stability? I mean, a rock is very stable.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.020
Ah, that's a fair challenge.

14:36.140 --> 14:40.980
A rock has a very stable pattern of engagement with the ground. It just sits there. It's a rock

14:40.980 --> 14:41.460
complex.

14:41.880 --> 14:47.900
It's a valid pushback. But the key is in the second part of the definition. Goal-explainable

14:47.900 --> 14:54.840
patterns of engagement. A rock isn't really engaging with the environment to solve a problem

14:54.840 --> 15:00.360
related to its own viability. It's just being subjected to the laws of physics, like gravity.

15:00.360 --> 15:05.980
It's passive. It's passive. The person ordering coffee is actively solving multiple viability

15:05.980 --> 15:11.840
problems simultaneously. Social interaction, caffeine acquisition, information gathering,

15:12.300 --> 15:18.240
nictine addiction, navigation. They are juggling multiple balls to maintain their state.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.340
The rock isn't juggling anything.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.600
Okay. So complexity is the number of balls you can keep in the air at once.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.340
Without having to consciously look at any of them.

15:27.340 --> 15:32.080
That's a fantastic way to put it. The more you can do without deliberation, the higher

15:32.080 --> 15:33.460
your synchronic complexity.

15:33.700 --> 15:34.180
Exactly.

15:34.700 --> 15:39.840
Which brings us right back to that crucial relationship with the world. We've established

15:39.840 --> 15:45.700
that we're looking at the now, and we're looking for fluent, layered activity. But where does

15:45.700 --> 15:51.320
this flow actually happen? It happens in what the paper calls the affordance landscape.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.860
The landscape of possibilities. It's the space you move through.

15:54.860 --> 16:00.660
Let's switch the visual in our heads again. The clock is gone. The reef is gone. Now I want you

16:00.660 --> 16:07.580
to picture a map. A massive, stylized subway map, like the London Underground map, with thousands

16:07.580 --> 16:09.580
of lines diverging and converging.

16:09.800 --> 16:16.320
That's a great image for it. That's the activity space. And each station, each potential stop

16:16.320 --> 16:17.300
is an affordance.

16:17.300 --> 16:22.220
Okay, so let's define affordance again, but really strictly in this relational sense, because

16:22.220 --> 16:28.160
I think people, myself included, can get tripped up thinking an affordance is just a feature.

16:28.540 --> 16:31.480
You know, my phone has the camera affordance.

16:31.480 --> 16:35.440
Right, and that's not quite it. It's not a feature of the object, and it's not a skill

16:35.440 --> 16:41.660
of the user. It is the handshake between the two. The potential for a meaningful interaction.

16:42.020 --> 16:43.540
The classic example is a chair.

16:43.540 --> 16:48.380
Right. The classic example is a chair. Does a simple wooden chair have the affordance

16:48.380 --> 16:49.280
of sitability?

16:49.840 --> 16:53.060
Well, yes. Of course. That's what it's for.

16:53.240 --> 17:00.160
For you, a human, yes. Your body has the right size, the right joint structure. The chair has

17:00.160 --> 17:05.680
the right height, the right flat surface. The relationship works. The affordance of sitting

17:05.680 --> 17:07.600
exists in that coupling.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.020
But what if you're an elephant?

17:09.020 --> 17:14.680
Then the chair is absolutely not for sitting. For an elephant, it might afford being smashed

17:14.680 --> 17:20.220
or being a minor obstacle. But the sitting affordance does not exist for the elephant

17:20.220 --> 17:22.100
chair coupling. It's gone.

17:22.460 --> 17:28.260
The paper uses a slightly more terrifying example. The affordance of breathing.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.600
Right. Let's look at the formula they use, just conceptually.

17:32.140 --> 17:37.660
Four netters is the set of all affordances, all activities, available to you at time, $10.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.320
My menu of options.

17:39.400 --> 17:45.380
Your menu of options. Right now, sitting in this studio, the activity breathing is on

17:45.380 --> 17:50.360
your menu. It's in your set four netters. You have lungs. That's the agent's contribution.

17:50.900 --> 17:56.200
And the room has air. That's the environment's contribution. The relation holds.

17:56.560 --> 18:00.280
But if you take me and drop me in the middle of the Pacific Ocean...

18:00.280 --> 18:04.980
Your internal machinery hasn't changed one bit. You still have the same lungs. You're just

18:04.980 --> 18:09.100
as smart. You have the same memories, the same capabilities you had a moment before.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.700
But the environment has changed.

18:10.800 --> 18:15.000
The environment has changed dramatically. The air is gone. The relation is broken. And

18:15.000 --> 18:19.180
so the breathing affordance instantly vanishes from your set affordance.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.680
And my overall complexity drops to zero pretty quickly after that.

18:23.860 --> 18:29.920
Tragically so. But it proves the point with brutal clarity. Complexity isn't something you

18:29.920 --> 18:32.580
just carry around inside your skin. It's relational.

18:32.580 --> 18:40.240
So a supercomputer. A machine with more processing power than all of humanity combined. If you just

18:40.240 --> 18:42.140
float it in the vacuum of space.

18:42.400 --> 18:49.020
It has almost zero complexity. It has no inputs to process. No outputs to affect the world.

18:49.320 --> 18:52.500
It can't do anything. It's just a warm, inert box.

18:52.500 --> 18:58.240
This really dismantles those old brain-in-a-vat thought experiments, doesn't it? We used to think

18:58.240 --> 19:03.740
if we could just perfectly simulate a brain, it would be conscious and complex all by itself.

19:04.080 --> 19:09.540
And this framework, which is part of a broader movement called inactivism, says that's nonsense.

19:10.020 --> 19:16.980
You are not a brain riding a body like a driver in a car. You are the entire coupled system of brain,

19:17.340 --> 19:19.760
body, and world all acting together.

19:19.760 --> 19:25.160
So if you take a simple organism, let's go back to our spider, and you put it in a really rich,

19:25.300 --> 19:30.000
complex environment with lots of anchor points, wind currents, different kinds of prey.

19:30.200 --> 19:35.580
Its activity space, its set of affordances just explodes. The spider in the rich environment

19:35.580 --> 19:37.400
system becomes incredibly complex.

19:37.680 --> 19:42.800
So this is the relational view. Complexity is what you can do with what you have, where you are.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.760
It's not additive. You can't just keep adding more parts to the robot to make it more complex.

19:47.760 --> 19:51.400
Yeah. You have to design the robot to better couple with its world.

19:51.620 --> 19:55.200
Okay. And that coupling, that idea of the affordance landscape,

19:55.600 --> 19:59.680
leads us to a really counterintuitive point. I think this is in section three.

19:59.880 --> 20:00.980
Yes. Constraints.

20:01.200 --> 20:07.580
Right. If complexity is about having options, about having a big, diverse menu of affordances,

20:08.280 --> 20:12.820
then surely the goal is to have all the options. Infinite affordances.

20:12.820 --> 20:17.220
I want to be able to fly and breathe underwater and see through walls.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.240
I'd definitely take the flight option.

20:19.400 --> 20:25.000
Me too. But the paper argues that infinite options wouldn't just be unhelpful,

20:25.200 --> 20:29.780
they would actually destroy you. This is a section on constraints and the power of no.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.740
It's one of my favorite parts of the paper.

20:32.020 --> 20:38.540
So explain this to me. Why would no be powerful? Why is can't sometimes better than can?

20:38.540 --> 20:44.980
It all comes down to the problem of information processing. Think about the concept of absence,

20:45.400 --> 20:51.080
as the paper puts it. Some affordances are absent simply because they are physically impossible for

20:51.080 --> 20:58.840
you. Like me trying to fly by flapping my arms. Exactly. That is a hard constraint imposed on you

20:58.840 --> 21:04.600
by gravity and your own biology. Now you might see that as a limitation. A bummer.

21:04.600 --> 21:12.540
It is a bummer. But the paper argues it's an incredible gift because constraint is prior to

21:12.540 --> 21:16.660
choice. What does that mean prior to choice? It means that because that option is physically

21:16.660 --> 21:22.380
impossible, your brain and your body do not have to waste a single calorie, a single millisecond,

21:22.540 --> 21:28.460
even considering it. Yeah. The decision has been made for you by the universe. I see. So when I'm

21:28.460 --> 21:34.520
standing at the edge of a cliff, I don't have this complex internal debate. Hmm. Should I flap my wings?

21:34.520 --> 21:39.720
Today? Or should I take the stairs? The universe has already removed flap my wings from my menu.

21:39.860 --> 21:44.720
It's already crossed it off for you. Now imagine if you could do anything. Imagine if every single

21:44.720 --> 21:51.660
atom in this room was a valid handle for you to grab. Imagine if every direction was a valid path

21:51.660 --> 21:56.620
for locomotion, including straight up. I'd be paralyzed. I wouldn't even know where to start.

21:56.680 --> 22:01.620
It's overwhelming. We call that combinatorial explosion in computer science. If the number of

22:01.620 --> 22:07.840
possibilities is nearly infinite, the time it would take to calculate the best one also becomes

22:07.840 --> 22:14.500
infinite. You would just freeze, trapped by choice. So constraints act like, what, blinders on a horse?

22:14.680 --> 22:18.940
That's a perfect analogy. They cut off all the peripheral noise and distraction,

22:19.340 --> 22:22.640
so you can just move forward on the path that's actually available to you.

22:22.640 --> 22:27.820
The paper talks about a relevance function here. It uses the Greek letter row.

22:27.980 --> 22:33.760
Right. The relevance function one rowway is the great filter. In this mathematical model,

22:34.320 --> 22:40.760
all the irrelevant or impossible activities, like you trying to fly or trying to walk through that

22:40.760 --> 22:47.080
solid wall, they get a relevance score of zero. So they're filtered out before they even reach my

22:47.080 --> 22:52.320
decision-making process. They never even enter the dynamics. This is what the paper calls the

22:52.320 --> 23:01.120
economization of activity. By making 99.9% of all theoretical actions impossible, nature allows us

23:01.120 --> 23:07.000
to become really, really good at the tiny fraction that is possible. I love the analogy of the musician

23:07.000 --> 23:12.200
for this. I think it makes it really clear. Well, if you sit a musician down on a piano and say,

23:12.200 --> 23:18.540
play any note that exists in the universe, they might just produce noise. It's too open. But if

23:18.540 --> 23:25.360
you give them a key signature, say B-flat minor, you're imposing a constraint. You're limiting their

23:25.360 --> 23:33.180
options. You're saying, don't play these six notes, only play these other ones. Yes. But that very

23:33.180 --> 23:39.580
limitation is what creates the structure. Because they don't have to waste brainpower thinking about

23:39.580 --> 23:46.000
all the wrong notes, they can now creatively and fluently explore the rich relationships between

23:46.000 --> 23:52.340
all the right notes. The constraint enables the complexity. That is a perfect encapsulation of

23:52.340 --> 23:58.200
the argument. Structure is just a positive-sounding word for constraint. You can't build a complex

23:58.200 --> 24:04.440
skyscraper without rigid steel beams that limit where the floors and walls can go. Without those limits,

24:04.740 --> 24:08.880
you don't have a building, you just have a pile of bricks. So, okay, let's recap where we are.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.780
We have the now, which is synchronic. We have the relation, which is the affordance.

24:12.960 --> 24:16.660
And we have the limit, which is the constraint. The three pillars so far.

24:16.940 --> 24:19.700
But let's look at the structure of these activities themselves.

24:20.460 --> 24:24.320
Section four of the paper is called structure, composition, and automation.

24:24.620 --> 24:29.780
Right. Because your affordance landscape, your menu of options, isn't just a flat,

24:30.020 --> 24:34.740
unorganized list. It's not a grocery list. Eat, sleep, walk, talk.

24:34.740 --> 24:41.080
It has a hierarchy. Exactly. It has a hierarchy. The paper makes a distinction between basic

24:41.080 --> 24:46.660
affordances and composite affordances. Okay. What's the difference? Basic affordances are the

24:46.660 --> 24:51.900
sort of atomic units of action. They're the Lego bricks. Things like grasping an object with your

24:51.900 --> 24:58.080
hand, focusing your eyes on a point, lifting a single foot. And composite affordances are the

24:58.080 --> 25:02.820
complex structures you build out of those Lego bricks, like making a sandwich.

25:02.820 --> 25:07.780
Making a sandwich is a perfect example. Or driving a car. You can't just drive a car

25:07.780 --> 25:13.060
as a single action. You have to perform a whole sequence of basic affordances.

25:13.460 --> 25:18.460
Turn the wheel, press the pedal, look in the mirror, move the shifter. You chain them together

25:18.460 --> 25:24.260
in a stable pattern. But here's the crucial part, and it gets back to fluency. If I had to consciously

25:24.260 --> 25:30.480
think about every single one of those basic affordances while making a sandwich, I'd starve to

25:30.480 --> 25:36.960
death before I ever got to eat. Okay. Now I must grasp the knife. Now apply downward pressure.

25:37.520 --> 25:42.640
Now slice the bread. Now stop slicing. It would take forever.

25:42.640 --> 25:48.320
And this brings us to what might be the most important mechanism for complexity growth in

25:48.320 --> 25:51.200
the entire paper. Relegation of control.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.520
Relegation. It sounds like you're being demoted or sent away.

25:55.520 --> 26:00.160
In this context, it's a huge promotion for the system's overall efficiency.

26:00.160 --> 26:06.240
When a composite activity like driving or making a sandwich becomes stable and reliable through

26:06.240 --> 26:09.920
practice, the agent stops consciously managing the details.

26:09.920 --> 26:14.160
You stop thinking about turning the wheel and you start thinking about the goal, like going to the

26:14.160 --> 26:19.120
store. Precisely. The low-level details get compressed and automated. They get chunked together.

26:19.120 --> 26:22.640
The paper has a term for this, right? The projection operator.

26:22.640 --> 26:26.640
Yes. The projection operator, which they denote with a dollar.

26:27.520 --> 26:34.320
The math is a bit dense, but the concept is beautiful. Imagine taking a thousand tiny distinct

26:34.320 --> 26:39.440
gods that represent your basic actions and then drawing a big circle around them and giving that

26:39.440 --> 26:43.920
whole collection a single simple label. One thing.

26:43.920 --> 26:49.120
So turn wheel, press gas, check mirror becomes drive.

26:49.120 --> 26:52.400
It gets projected onto a simpler higher level description.

26:53.280 --> 26:58.800
You now treat that complex chain of actions as if it were a single basic unit. This is the

26:58.800 --> 27:00.320
automation we were talking about earlier.

27:00.320 --> 27:05.040
And this solves the manager problem, the homunculus fallacy. Tell me more about that.

27:05.040 --> 27:11.520
Well, there's this old sort of fallacy in AI and cognitive science that for a system to be

27:11.520 --> 27:16.880
coordinated, you need a central executive or a manager in the brain that's supervising everything,

27:16.880 --> 27:21.120
a little man in the head pulling all the levers. And this model says you don't need that little

27:21.120 --> 27:27.040
man. Right. If the system can automate its own subroutines, if the legs can just handle the walking

27:27.040 --> 27:31.760
so the brain doesn't have to, you don't need a manager for the legs. You relegate control.

27:31.760 --> 27:39.520
You relegate the control down to the limbs themselves or to the spinal cord or to the

27:39.520 --> 27:45.840
cerebellum, to these subconscious embodied habits. And this allows the agent to become incredibly

27:46.480 --> 27:54.400
mind bogglingly complex without needing a massive energy guzzling brain to micromanage every single

27:54.400 --> 27:58.800
twitch. So complexity isn't just about how many things you can do. It's about how many things

27:58.800 --> 28:04.320
you can do without thinking about them. It's about how many layers of trusted automation you were

28:04.320 --> 28:10.000
standing on top of at any given moment. You're standing on a pyramid of your own automated habits.

28:10.000 --> 28:16.000
But pyramids can crumble. And this is where the paper takes a darker, but I think even more fascinating

28:16.720 --> 28:22.640
turn. This is section five. Robustness, breakdown and flexibility. Right. This is the,

28:22.640 --> 28:27.280
so what happens when things go wrong section. And it starts by redefining robustness. We usually

28:27.280 --> 28:33.200
think of a robust system as being like a tank. It's hard, it's armored, it's unbreakable. If a tank

28:33.200 --> 28:39.600
hits a small wall, the wall breaks, the tank keeps going. But that's a very rigid, brittle definition of

28:39.600 --> 28:45.840
robustness. The paper argues for a different view, which they call viability. So what's a viability?

28:45.840 --> 28:53.600
Viability, or true robustness, isn't about never failing. It's not about executing action A perfectly

28:53.600 --> 29:00.640
every time. It's about having action B, C, and D available in your back pocket for the moment when

29:00.640 --> 29:08.960
action A inevitably fails. So it's the difference between a tank and maybe a tracer, a parkour athlete.

29:08.960 --> 29:16.080
That's a great comparison. The tank has one primary mode of engagement. Drive forward, crush obstacle.

29:16.080 --> 29:22.400
If the ground suddenly falls away into a deep chasm, the tank is finished. It has zero other options.

29:22.400 --> 29:28.560
It's stuck. It's stuck. The parkour athlete is all about flexibility. If the wall is too high to climb,

29:28.560 --> 29:33.920
they find a way to jump off another surface. If a ledge is slippery, they slide along it. If they fall,

29:33.920 --> 29:39.120
they know how to roll to dissipate the impact. They have a rich and diverse space of affordances.

29:39.120 --> 29:44.240
They have options. Exactly. The paper defines robustness as the ability to maintain a navigable

29:44.240 --> 29:50.480
space of activity. As long as the set of possible actions, which they call TAT, is greater than zero,

29:50.480 --> 29:54.960
as long as you have at least one move you can make, you are still in the game. You're viable.

29:54.960 --> 30:01.360
And this leads to the most interesting part, the idea of breakdown. Usually we think of a breakdown

30:01.360 --> 30:07.840
as the ultimate failure state. You know, the system crashed. But Fliction says a breakdown event is

30:07.840 --> 30:14.720
actually informative. It's a source of information. Think back to your driving analogy. You're fluently

30:14.720 --> 30:20.560
driving to work. You're thinking about your day, listening to the radio. You are on autopilot.

30:20.560 --> 30:27.600
The drive to work composite affordance is active. It is. Then suddenly your car hits a patch of black

30:27.600 --> 30:33.920
ice and begins to skid. Okay. The autopilot disengages instantly. All alarms go off. What

30:33.920 --> 30:39.600
happens to your awareness? Where does your attention go? It zooms right in. Suddenly I am intensely aware

30:39.600 --> 30:45.280
of the steering wheel in my hands. I can feel the vibration from the tires through the chassis. I'm

30:45.280 --> 30:52.160
consciously pumping the brakes. I'm no longer driving to work. I am correcting a dangerous skid. You've put it

30:52.160 --> 30:57.360
perfectly. The high level composite affordance of drive to work has collapsed. It's failed. And the

30:57.360 --> 31:03.920
basic affordances, steer, brake, look, have rushed back to the surface of my consciousness. The

31:03.920 --> 31:10.880
relegation of control has been undone. It's been undone. And the peeper's brilliant insight is that this

31:10.880 --> 31:18.160
moment of breakdown proves the underlying complexity of the system. How so? Because if you were a truly

31:18.160 --> 31:24.720
simple machine, like a toy car on a track, you would just crash. You wouldn't have any lower layers of

31:24.720 --> 31:31.920
control to fall back on. The very fact that you can decompose the fluent action, you can fluidly shift

31:31.920 --> 31:38.480
from driving to steering and braking, shows that all that complexity was there all along. It was just hidden

31:38.480 --> 31:45.120
by your own fluency. So a system that breaks down gracefully and then reorganizes itself to cope with the

31:45.120 --> 31:51.760
new situation is actually the height of complexity. It's the pinnacle. And this reorganization doesn't

31:51.760 --> 31:58.240
have to be some high level intelligent plan. It can be what the paper calls morphological interaction.

31:58.240 --> 32:03.040
You don't need a master plan to correct a skid. You just use your body. You turn into the skid.

32:03.040 --> 32:07.680
You feel the physics of the situation. You sort of bump into the world in a different way until

32:07.680 --> 32:12.640
stability returns. This feels like it connects directly to the philosophical part of the paper,

32:12.640 --> 32:18.400
the intentional stance discussed in section six. It does. Because when my car is skidding on ice,

32:18.400 --> 32:25.200
I'm not really planning in a cool, detached way. I'm just reacting. But an outside observer would

32:25.200 --> 32:30.080
absolutely say he is trying to regain control. They would assign a goal to my actions.

32:30.080 --> 32:39.440
And that brings us to the big philosophical pivot. Can we legitimately say a system has a goal

32:39.440 --> 32:45.600
or an intention, if it doesn't have a human-like brain, to consciously represent that goal?

32:45.600 --> 32:48.320
This is the ghost in the machine question all over again, isn't it?

32:48.320 --> 32:54.240
It is. And the paper handles it in a very pragmatic way by borrowing from the philosopher Daniel Dennett.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.200
He proposed something called the intentional stance.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.160
What's the stance?

32:58.160 --> 33:06.000
It's a practical tool, not a metaphysical claim. It simply asks the question, is it explanatorily fruitful

33:06.000 --> 33:09.280
to describe the system's behavior as if it has a goal?

33:09.280 --> 33:12.480
So does it help us understand and predict what's going to happen next?

33:12.480 --> 33:18.720
Exactly. Take a heat-seeking missile. Does it love heat? Does it desire to be near the jet engine?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.960
Does it hate the cold emptiness of the sky?

33:20.960 --> 33:24.000
No, of course not. It's just a bunch of sensors and circuitry.

33:24.000 --> 33:30.640
Right. But if your job is to predict where that missile is going to go, it is incredibly useful

33:30.640 --> 33:34.000
and efficient to say it wants to hit the hot target.

33:34.000 --> 33:40.240
Because if I tried to predict its path by calculating the voltage across every wire inside it,

33:40.240 --> 33:46.320
I'd be there for 100 years and the plane would already be gone. The goal is a predictive shortcut.

33:46.320 --> 33:52.960
It's an explanatory filter. It filters out all the messy, low-level details of the mechanism,

33:52.960 --> 33:58.400
allows us to focus on the coherent, organized structure of the behavior.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.160
And the paper argues that for the purpose of measuring complexity,

34:02.160 --> 34:05.520
we don't care if the agent really has a goal deep in its soul.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.960
We just care if its behavior is structured as if it has a goal.

34:08.960 --> 34:09.600
You got it.

34:09.600 --> 34:14.240
And this is the move that allows us to finally compare a biological cell

34:14.240 --> 34:16.800
and a sophisticated robot on the same terms.

34:16.800 --> 34:22.880
Yes. A white blood cell that is chasing a bacterium through your bloodstream,

34:22.880 --> 34:27.200
and a Roomba that is seeking its charging dock when its battery is low.

34:27.200 --> 34:30.720
Neither of them has a brain in the human sense. Neither is thinking,

34:30.720 --> 34:32.880
oh, I'm hungry for electricity.

34:32.880 --> 34:39.920
But both of them exhibit what the paper calls behavioral complexity, or CBATT.

34:39.920 --> 34:46.640
They behave in a stable, goal-directed way. They act as if they have intent.

34:46.640 --> 34:51.200
And by adopting this stance, we can use the same language, and even the same math,

34:51.200 --> 34:56.720
to describe the complexity of a living organism and an artificial one. We don't have to get bogged

34:56.720 --> 35:02.320
down asking, but does it have a soul? We just ask, does its behavior have a direction?

35:02.320 --> 35:07.920
It cleanly removes the metaphysics from the equation, which is absolutely essential if you

35:07.920 --> 35:11.360
want to build a rigorous objective science of complexity.

35:11.360 --> 35:16.560
This leads us to the final problem. And it's a very human problem. The problem of comparison.

35:16.560 --> 35:17.360
We love a winner.

35:17.360 --> 35:20.880
We love a winner. We need a leaderboard. We want to be able to rank things.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.480
We want to know who is number one.

35:22.480 --> 35:27.120
Exactly. I want to be able to say, humans are a hundred out of a hundred on the complexity scale.

35:27.600 --> 35:31.760
Chimps are an 80. Spiders are a 10. My Roomba is a 2.

35:32.320 --> 35:38.000
And the paper looks that desire and says, quite firmly, stop it. You can't do that. It's a

35:38.000 --> 35:42.880
meaningless exercise. Why not? Why can't we just measure everyone's affordance landscape and see

35:42.880 --> 35:48.080
who has the most? Because of a concept from mathematics called incomparability.

35:49.200 --> 35:53.520
The paper uses the symbol of two parallel lines to represent this.

35:53.520 --> 36:00.800
$8 key AT. Parallel A to an AT. That means the two agents are running on parallel tracks that never

36:00.800 --> 36:06.800
intersect in a way that allows for a simple greater than or less than judgment.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.440
It's the classic apples and oranges problem.

36:09.440 --> 36:14.800
It's the submarine versus the skyscraper problem. Which one is better or more complex?

36:14.800 --> 36:19.040
Well, it's a nonsensical question. The submarine is better at moving underwater,

36:19.040 --> 36:22.080
and the skyscraper is better at staying still and being tall.

36:22.080 --> 36:29.040
Exactly. Their activity spaces, their sets of affordances are almost completely disjoint.

36:29.760 --> 36:34.800
One has affordances related to buoyancy and pressure. The other has affordances related

36:34.800 --> 36:41.760
to structural load and wind shear. There's no universal neutral metric of complexity that you

36:41.760 --> 36:45.200
can apply fairly to both. So you can only compare them locally?

36:45.200 --> 36:48.880
You can only compare them locally. You can ask which is better at withstanding water pressure,

36:48.880 --> 36:53.600
and the submarine wins. You can ask which can house more people, and the skyscraper wins.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.880
But you can't ask which is globally more complex.

36:56.880 --> 37:00.640
The question is mathematically meaningless within this framework,

37:00.640 --> 37:04.640
and this leads to what the paper calls plurality and indeterminacy.

37:06.000 --> 37:11.680
We just have to accept that there is no single peak on the mountain of evolution or design.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.520
There are many, many different peaks.

37:13.520 --> 37:20.960
That is surprisingly humble. It's a framework that intentionally takes humans off the pedestal.

37:20.960 --> 37:27.600
We aren't the ultimate goal of evolution. We're just one possible type of complex system among many.

37:27.600 --> 37:32.800
We're just one specific and in many ways very weird configuration of affordances.

37:32.800 --> 37:39.360
A spider is another. A coral reef is another. A sophisticated AI running a global supply chain is

37:39.360 --> 37:42.800
another. They are all valid. They are all real forms of complexity.

37:42.800 --> 37:47.840
Okay, so let's try to bring this all home. Let's synthesize this. We started this journey with the

37:47.840 --> 37:53.120
image of the clock and the reef. We did. We moved from the clean, deterministic,

37:53.120 --> 37:59.600
mechanical view to the messy, relational, ecological view. We learned about synchronic complexity,

37:59.600 --> 38:04.560
the radical idea that what matters is what you can do now, not how you learn to do it.

38:04.560 --> 38:10.000
Then we learned about the affordance landscape, that complexity doesn't live inside your head.

38:10.000 --> 38:13.120
It lives in the relationship between you and your world.

38:13.120 --> 38:21.040
We saw how constraints, the power of no, are not limitations but are actually the secret ingredient

38:21.040 --> 38:25.840
that structures behavior and makes complexity possible in the first place.

38:25.840 --> 38:32.320
And we saw how relegation and automation are the engines that allow that complexity to scale up,

38:32.320 --> 38:36.560
to build pyramids of habit so you don't get overwhelmed by the details.

38:36.560 --> 38:42.720
And finally, we have to let go of our desire to rank everything on a single human-centric line.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.280
We have to accept that complexity is plural.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.800
Rich forms of agency need not be intelligent in order to be real.

38:49.760 --> 38:52.800
I think that's the final powerful argument of the paper.

38:52.800 --> 38:57.040
It really does change how I look at the world. I find myself looking for the brain

38:57.040 --> 39:01.920
behind things less and less. Instead, I'm looking for the flow. I'm looking for the fit.

39:01.920 --> 39:02.640
The coupling.

39:02.640 --> 39:08.080
The coupling. When I see a bird effortlessly navigating a dense forest at high speed,

39:08.080 --> 39:13.120
I'm no longer impressed by its abstract IQ. I'm just in awe of its perfect,

39:13.120 --> 39:17.280
fluent coupling with the air, the branches, its own momentum.

39:17.280 --> 39:24.880
It democratizes agency. It allows us to finally appreciate the genius of the mindless.

39:24.880 --> 39:31.760
So I want to leave you, our listener, with a thought to chew on today. A bit of homework,

39:31.760 --> 39:32.240
if you will.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.640
Always good to send them off with a puzzle.

39:34.640 --> 39:39.760
Think about your own day. We pride ourselves on our intelligence,

39:39.760 --> 39:44.800
our conscious planning, our deliberate learning, our inner managerial brain.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.360
But I want you to conduct an audit of your own complexity. How much of your day is actually spent

39:51.360 --> 39:55.600
in that mode of thinking? And how much is spent in a state of fluency?

39:55.600 --> 40:01.360
Exactly. Driving your car, typing on a keyboard, walking down a crowded street,

40:01.360 --> 40:06.320
cooking a familiar meal, navigating the subtle cues of a conversation with a friend.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.880
All the things you do without really doing them. Right. So here's the question. Are you actually

40:10.880 --> 40:16.960
at your most complex, your most capable, when you are thinking the least? Is your autopilot

40:16.960 --> 40:20.480
actually the most sophisticated, most impressive thing about you?

40:20.480 --> 40:27.600
That is a very humbling thought to end on. Thanks for taking the deep dive. See you next time.
