it constructs it, inferring an outside world from ambiguous input. In Being You, Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex, relates his explanation for how the “inner universe of subjective experience relates to, and can be explained in terms of, biological and physical processes unfolding in brains and bodies.” He contends that “experiences of being you, or of being me, emerge from the way the brain predicts and controls the internal state of the body.” 

Prediction has come into vogue in academic circles in recent years. Seth and the philosopher Andy Clark, a colleague at Sussex, refer to predictions made by the brain as “controlled hallucinations.” The idea is that the brain is always constructing models of the world to explain and predict incoming information; it updates these models when prediction and the experience we get from our sensory inputs diverge. 

“Chairs aren’t red,” Seth writes, “just as they aren’t ugly or old-fashioned or avant-garde … When I look at a red chair, the redness I experience depends both on properties of the chair and on properties of my brain. It corresponds to the content of a set of perceptual predictions about the ways in which a specific kind of surface reflects light.” 


Seth is not particularly interested in redness, or even in color more generally. Rather his larger claim is that this same process applies to all of perception: “The entirety of perceptual experience is a neuronal fantasy that remains yoked to the world through a continuous making and remaking of perceptual best guesses, of controlled hallucinations. You could even say that we’re all hallucinating all the time. It’s just that when we agree about our hallucinations, that’s what we call reality.”

Cognitive scientists often rely on atypical examples to gain understanding of what’s really happening. Seth takes the reader through a fun litany of optical illusions and demonstrations, some quite familiar and others less so. Squares that are in fact the same shade appear to be different; spirals printed on paper appear to spontaneously rotate; an obscure image turns out to be a woman kissing a horse; a face shows up in a bathroom sink. Re-creating the mind’s psychedelic powers in silicon, an artificial-intelligence-powered virtual-reality setup that he and his colleagues created produces a Hunter Thompson–esque menagerie of animal parts emerging piecemeal from other objects in a square on the Sussex University campus. This series of examples, in Seth’s telling, “chips away at the beguiling but unhelpful intuition that consciousness is one thing—one big scary mystery in search of one big scary solution.” Seth’s perspective might be unsettling to those who prefer to believe that things are as they seem to be: “Experiences of free will are perceptions. The flow of time is a perception.” 

Seth is on comparatively solid ground when he describes how the brain shapes experience, what philosophers call the “easy” problems of consciousness. They’re easy only in comparison to the “hard” problem: why subjective experience exists at all as a feature of the universe. Here he treads awkwardly, introducing the “real” problem, which is to “explain, predict, and control the phenomenological properties of conscious experience.” It’s not clear how the real problem differs from the easy problems, but somehow, he says, tackling it will get us some way toward resolving the hard problem. Now that would be a neat trick.

Where Seth relates, for the most part, the experiences of people with typical brains wrestling with atypical stimuli, in Coming to Our Senses, Susan Barry, an emeritus professor of neurobiology at Mount Holyoke college, tells the stories of two people who acquired new senses later in life than is usual. Liam McCoy, who had been nearly blind since he was an infant, was able to see almost clearly after a series of operations when he was 15 years old. Zohra Damji was profoundly deaf until she was given a cochlear implant at the unusually late age of 12. As Barry explains, Damji’s surgeon “told her aunt that, had he known the length and degree of Zohra’s deafness, he would not have performed the operation.” Barry’s compassionate, nuanced, and observant exposition is informed by her own experience:

At age forty-eight, I experienced a dramatic improvement in my vision, a change that repeatedly brought me moments of childlike glee. Cross-eyed from early infancy, I had seen the world primarily through one eye. Then, in mid-life, I learned, through a program of vision therapy, to use my eyes together. With each glance, everything I saw took on a new look. I could see the volume and 3D shape of the empty space between things. Tree branches reached out toward me; light fixtures floated. A visit to the produce section of the supermarket, with all its colors and 3D shapes, could send me into a sort of ecstasy. 

Barry was overwhelmed with joy at her new capacities, which she describes as “seeing in a new way.” She takes pains to point out how different this is from “seeing for the first time.” A person who has grown up with eyesight can grasp a scene in a single glance. “But where we perceive a three-dimensional landscape full of objects and people, a newly sighted adult sees a hodgepodge of lines and patches of colors appearing on one flat plane.” As McCoy described his experience of walking up and down stairs to Barry: 

The upstairs are large alternating bars of light and dark and the downstairs are a series of small lines. My main focus is to balance and step IN BETWEEN lines, never on one … Of course going downstairs you step in between every line but upstairs you skip every other bar. All the while, when I move, the stairs are skewing and changing.

Even a sidewalk was tricky, at first, to navigate. He had to judge whether a line “indicated the junction between flat sidewalk blocks, a crack in the cement, the outline of a stick, a shadow cast by an upright pole, or the presence of a sidewalk step,” Barry explains. “Should he step up, down, or over the line, or should he ignore it entirely?” As McCoy says, the complexity of his perceptual confusion probably cannot be fully explained in terms that sighted people are used to.


The same, of course, is true of hearing. Raw audio can be hard to untangle. Barry describes her own ability to listen to the radio while working, effortlessly distinguishing the background sounds in the room from her own typing and from the flute and violin music coming over the radio. “Like object recognition, sound recognition depends upon communication between lower and higher sensory areas in the brain … This neural attention to frequency helps with sound source recognition. Drop a spoon on a tiled kitchen floor, and you know immediately whether the spoon is metal or wood by the high- or low-frequency sound waves it produces upon impact.” Most people acquire such capacities in infancy. Damji didn’t. She would often ask others what she was hearing, but had an easier time learning to distinguish sounds that she made herself. She was surprised by how noisy eating potato chips was, telling Barry: “To me, potato chips were always such a delicate thing, the way they were so lightweight, and so fragile that you could break them easily, and I expected them to be soft-sounding. But the amount of noise they make when you crunch them was something out of place. So loud.” 

As Barry recounts, at first Damji was frightened by all sounds, “because they were meaningless.” But as she grew accustomed to her new capabilities, Damji found that “a sound is not a noise anymore but more like a story or an event.” The sound of laughter came to her as a complete surprise, and she told Barry it was her favorite. As Barry writes, “Although we may be hardly conscious of background sounds, we are also dependent upon them for our emotional well-being.” One strength of the book is in the depth of her connection with both McCoy and Damji. She spent years speaking with them and corresponding as they progressed through their careers: McCoy is now an ophthalmology researcher at Washington University in St. Louis, while Damji is a doctor. From the details of how they learned to see and hear, Barry concludes, convincingly, that “since the world and everything in it is constantly changing, it’s surprising that we can recognize anything at all.”

In What Makes Us Smart, Samuel Gershman, a psychology professor at Harvard, says that there are “two fundamental principles governing the organization of human intelligence.” Gershman’s book is not particularly accessible; it lacks connective tissue and is peppered with equations that are incompletely explained. He writes that intelligence is governed by “inductive bias,” meaning we prefer certain hypotheses before making observations, and “approximation bias,” which means we take mental shortcuts when faced with limited resources. Gershman uses these ideas to explain everything from visual illusions to conspiracy theories to the development of language, asserting that what looks dumb is often “smart.”

“The brain is evolution’s solution to the twin problems of limited data and limited computation,” he writes.

He portrays the mind as a raucous committee of modules that somehow helps us fumble our way through the day. “Our mind consists of multiple systems for learning and decision making that only exchange limited amounts of information with one another,” he writes. If he’s correct, it’s impossible for even the most introspective and insightful among us to fully grasp what’s going  on inside our own head. As Damji wrote in a letter to Barry: 

When I had no choice but to learn Swahili in medical school in order to be able to talk to the patients—that is when I realized how much potential we have—especially when we are pushed out of our comfort zone. The brain learns it somehow.

perception, consciousness, and intelligence.</p><ol><li><p>"Being You" by Anil Seth focuses on how our brain constructs our subjective experiences by making predictions about the world based on sensory input. These predictions, often referred to as "controlled hallucinations," shape our perceptions of reality. Seth argues that our entire perceptual experience is a product of our brain constantly making and updating these predictions.</p></li><li><p>"Coming to Our Senses" by Susan Barry tells the stories of individuals who gained new senses later in life, such as sight or hearing. The book illustrates how the brain adapts and constructs perceptions in response to new sensory information, emphasizing that our experiences are not simply "seeing for the first time" but rather a complex process of interpretation.</p></li><li><p>"What Makes Us Smart" by Samuel Gershman delves into the organization of human intelligence, proposing two fundamental principles: "inductive bias" and "approximation bias." Gershman suggests that the brain is a collection of modules that exchange limited information, leading to mental shortcuts and adaptive decision-making based on limited data and computational resources.</p></li></ol><p>In summary, these books shed light on the intricate and dynamic nature of human perception, consciousness, and intelligence, challenging traditional notions of how we understand the world around us.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Our brains exist in a state of “controlled hallucination”
Three new books lay bare the weirdness of how our brains process the world around us.

seeing is believing concept
ANDREA DAQUINO
When you and I look at the same object we assume that we’ll both see the same color. Whatever our identities or ideologies, we believe our realities meet at the most basic level of perception. But in 2015, a viral internet phenomenon tore this assumption asunder. The incident was known simply as “The Dress.”

For the uninitiated: a photograph of a dress appeared on the internet, and people disagreed about its color. Some saw it as white and gold; others saw it as blue and black. For a time, it was all anyone online could talk about.

Eventually, vision scientists figured out what was happening. It wasn’t our computer screens or our eyes. It was the mental calculations that brains make when we see. Some people unconsciously inferred that the dress was in direct light and mentally subtracted yellow from the image, so they saw blue and black stripes. Others saw it as being in shadow, where bluish light dominates. Their brains mentally subtracted blue from the image, and came up with a white and gold dress. </div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

titled "Context Changes Everything" explores the profound impact of context on how we perceive and understand the world. It delves into the idea that our interpretations, actions, and decisions are deeply influenced by the specific context in which we find ourselves. The book challenges the notion of universal laws or fixed rules governing human behavior and cognition, emphasizing that context plays a crucial role in shaping our experiences and interactions.</p><p>Juarrero's perspective suggests that understanding the complexity of context is essential in fields such as philosophy, cognitive science, and ethics. By recognizing the dynamic interplay between individuals and their environment, the book advocates for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of human behavior and decision-making. Overall, "Context Changes Everything" offers a thought-provoking exploration of the significance of context in shaping our perception and understanding of the world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">I 1 What Went Wrong?

Wrong? The Backstory" by Alicia Juarrero continues its exploration into the interplay between context and constraints. The chapters delve into various concepts and phenomena, including repetition, replication, and reproduction. It discusses the unity of type in species, demes, and memes, as well as density, isolation, and buffers in the context of constraints.</p><p>The book further examines motility and migration, which represent the relaxation of constraints. It explores the concepts of templates, frameworks, scaffolds, and affordances, with a focus on scaffolding and its types.</p><p>Another significant theme in the book is persistence and its relation to thermodynamics. The principle of persistence and selection by persistence are discussed, highlighting how delaying the second law of thermodynamics plays a role in various processes.</p><p>Sedimentation and entrenchment are also explored, considering the concepts of memory, records, registers, and generative entrenchment of validated constraints.</p><p>The book delves into many-to-one transitions, effective and analog control, tagging emergent properties, and analog control's role in energy management and multiply realizable domains.</p><p>Additionally, the concepts of holons, holarchy, heterarchy, and hierarchy are discussed, along with levels of organization and control hierarchy.</p><p>Overall, "What Went Wrong? The Backstory" offers a comprehensive exploration of complex phenomena, providing valuable insights into the principles and dynamics of various systems influenced by context and constraints.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">III

osophical and scientif i c presuppositions that go without saying entangle 
us in never- ending mazes. 
In the history of ideas, claims that identity consists of a def i ning essence 
have a long backstory. In fact, one could arguably claim that it is among 
the oldest backstories in philosophy, a backstory that involves the paradox 
of the One and the Many. What makes different entities (e.g., dachs- 
hunds, boxers, chihuahuas, Great Danes) the same, that is, dogs? What 
makes anything continue being the same thing? How is it that something 
can persist as itself— despite changes wrought by either developmental 
processes, the environment, or internal malfunction? 
Issues with identity are not new; the problem was fi rst posed in the sixth 
century BCE. The classical version went as follows: If all the planks of the 
ship of Theseus are replaced over time, is it still “the ship of Theseus,” 
even when not one of the original planks remains? Does anything persist 
as the same thing, the ship of Theseus, despite such signif i cant alterations? 
How is change compatible with remaining the same? What does same 
mean, in this context or any other? 
In 2019, Chinese scientists inserted a human gene into the brains of 
eleven monkeys; those monkeys then outperformed normal monkeys in 
tests of short- term memory. Even more striking, the modif i ed monkeys’ 
brain developed into an organ more like a human’s than like that of 
the unmodif i ed monkeys (Regalado 2019). Are these animals now partly 
human? In 2021, an international team of scientists injected human 
stem cells into primates (Subbaraman 2021). The interspecies chimeras 
grew for two weeks before being destroyed. If a human being’s body 
parts are gradually replaced with silicon components until no original 
organic material remains, would they still be human, or a cyborg? If all

my memories disappeared, or if my beliefs suddenly became entirely dif- 
ferent, would I still be me? What is it to be me? Just as the Ship of Theseus 
is one of the oldest backstories in philosophy, tales of aliens taking over 
the bodies of earthlings are among the oldest themes in science fi ction.1 
Today’s controversy about identity is not just an old story; it is also 
an oft- told story (Toulmin 1990; Juarrero 1999). However, the central 
theme of this book is not identity, nor will this book be solely a survey 
of these debates. The problem of identity happens to be a noteworthy 
philosophical topic that encapsulates in a single controversy three cat- 
egories that have been egregiously responsible for framing our views of 
reality in a misleading manner. Our understanding of many concepts, not 
only those that arise with respect to identity, continues to be misdirected 
by outdated and erroneous ideas about three central issues:

• Are wholes different from aggregates? 
• Are context and history part of the fabric of reality? 
• How do cause and effect work? 
The three questions are so deeply interwoven in the way we see things 
that a discussion of one inevitably brings to bear the others. The problem 
of wholes and aggregates is the problem of Types or Kinds and Essences, 
the problem of context and history is the problem of Interactions and 
Relations, and the problem of causes and effects is, well, the huge philo- 
sophical problem of Causation. 
The last one, Causation, is the most recalcitrant and pervasive of the 
three. It wraps around the other two: Do interactions among individ- 
ual entities create real novelty in the form of coherent wholes? Can the 
context in which an event occurs have any inf l uence either on whether it 
happens at all or on exactly what happens? 
This chapter presents highlights from the history of these ideas. It 
describes how relations and interactions, context and history, came to be 
thought of as causally impotent; how seemingly coherent totalities were 
reduced to nothing but aggregates; and how the idea of cause and effect 
came to be restricted to energy- transferring processes. These controver- 
sies are problematic, not only because of what they have to say about the 
nature of identity; they mainly arise because of our deeply fl awed views 
about causality and coherence— about the causes of coherence. Once we 
understand what went wrong with these two notions, we can begin to rei- 
magine a different and more inclusive interpretive framework that can also 
make room for identity as contextually embedded coherence and interde- 
pendence. The book takes preliminary steps in that direction.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

identity. It begins by mentioning the classical Ship of Theseus paradox, questioning what makes different entities the same (e.g., different dog breeds) and how something can persist as itself despite changes. The passage then mentions recent scientific experiments involving the modification of animal brains and bodies, raising questions about identity and whether alterations make them different beings.</p><p>The author highlights that issues with identity have a long history in philosophy and are intertwined with three central questions:</p><ol><li>Are wholes different from aggregates? (Problem of Types or Kinds and Essences)</li><li>Are context and history part of the fabric of reality? (Problem of Interactions and Relations)</li><li>How do cause and effect work? (The problem of Causation)</li></ol><p>The chapter aims to provide an overview of the historical development of these ideas and how they have influenced our understanding of identity. It addresses the reduction of seemingly coherent totalities to mere aggregates and the restriction of cause and effect to energy-transferring processes.</p><p>The passage concludes by asserting that these controversies are rooted in flawed views about causality and coherence, leading to the need for a different interpretive framework that considers identity as contextually embedded coherence and interdependence. The book aims to explore and reimagine such a framework.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Types, Kinds, and Essences 
The fable of the Scorpion and the Frog shows how “identity” has tradi- 
tionally been thought to capture the essence that uniquely distinguishes 
something from everything else— everything else that something is not. 
The scorpion asks the frog to ferry it across the river safely. When the 
frog hesitates, fearful the scorpion would kill it, the scorpion protests 
that doing so would mean that both would drown. The frog accepts that 
reasoning. Halfway across the river the scorpion stings the frog. As they 
are both drowning, the dying frog asks the scorpion, “Why did you do 
that?” To which the scorpion replies, “I couldn’t help it. It’s my nature.” 
Thinking of identity in this way suggests that if certain properties, inter- 
nal to the creature, were missing, it would no longer be itself because 
those properties def i ne what it is to be a scorpion. They capture, that is, a 
thing’s fundamental essence and therefore its identity. 
The idea of nature or essence as internal and standalone is notewor- 
thy because of the unacknowledged assumptions it uncritically accepts. 
Essence as internal represents a refusal to acknowledge that interactions 
and relations play a role in a thing’s nature; it also refuses to recognize that 
relational properties like coordination, integration, and context embed- 
dedness are real. It ignores both the past and current circumstances. It 
underpins, in short, a worldview that dismisses time and place— context 
in general— from reality. These become passive containers instead. Such 
failures make it impossible to understand coherence and identity. 
That backstory goes as follows. 
Beginning with Thales in the sixth century BCE, pre- Socratic philoso- 
phers embarked on a search for the essence and nature of reality. What 
made pre- Socratics different from their precursors was their faith in 
reason and logic, as opposed to an unquestioning acceptance of mythic 
tales (Juarrero 1993). Is Water the foundation of reality, asked Thales? 
Is there more than one fundamental essence— perhaps, air, wind, fi re, as 
well as water? Maybe all four, as Empedocles proposed? Or is the essence 
of reality change (Heraclitus)? Or an unchanging Plenum (Parmenides)? 
Lucretius, the fi rst recorded atomist, noted that whatever turns out to be 
fundamental must be in- divisible— a- tom. Otherwise, it could be decom- 
posed into more simple stuff and so would not be fundamental. The late 
Carl Sagan, host of the popular public television series Cosmos, lamented 
that the history of ideas went wrong when Socrates veered from this 
pre- Socratic interest in cosmological and natural questions and turned 
instead to ethical and normative ones.

Fast forward to the eighteenth century. Modern English atomist John 
Dalton noticed that chemicals could be combined into more complex sub- 
stances or broken down into more fundamental elements. In a nod toward 
Lucretius, Dalton called the fundamental particles atoms and identif i ed 
weight as their primary property. In that same century, French chemist 
Antoine Lavoisier added mass as a second primary property of atoms.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center

The concept of nature or essence as internal and standalone is highlighted, which overlooks the role of interactions, relations, and context in defining a thing's nature.</p><p>The historical backdrop of the search for the essence and nature of reality is presented, starting with pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales, who sought to understand the fundamental essence of reality. The passage mentions different perspectives, such as the proposal of multiple fundamental essences by Empedocles and the idea of change as the essence by Heraclitus. It also notes that the modern English atomist John Dalton identified atoms as fundamental particles with weight and mass as their primary properties.</p><p>Overall, the passage explores how the traditional understanding of identity and essence has evolved from ancient philosophical inquiries to modern scientific perspectives, and it raises questions about the role of interactions, context, and relations in defining the nature of things.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

Modern science and philosophy consolidated the idea of primary proper- 
ties as the ground of reality and therefore of identity; only primary prop- 
erties constitute the essence of things. One of the features that allegedly 
makes primary properties primary is their ability to exist on their own, 
independent of others; they do not depend on anything else either to exist 
or to be perceived. Properties like atomic weight and mass— those that 
underlie solidity, extension, and quantity— are often listed as preeminent 
examples of primary properties. From this perspective, essence and iden- 
tity are what might be called internalist concepts: they pick out proper- 
ties that are internal to the entity in question; they are also objectively 
measurable and observer independent. 
Once the internalist def i nition was adopted, concluding that interactions 
contribute nothing fundamental to reality followed. Relations with other 
entities in the environment and with the past bring context to bear, but 
because context was viewed as a container external to the thing’s essence, 
it too was set aside as irrelevant to identity. The philosophical conundrum 
posed by the measurement problem in quantum physics originates in this 
framing. 
Contrast the seeming ontological independence and self- suff i ciency of 
atomic mass and weight with the context dependence of color and sound. 
It has been known since classical times (Democritus) that fl avors, odors, 
color, sounds, and even temperature are inherently relational and con- 
textual. Inserting a hand in a bucket of tepid water feels cold if it comes 
after inserting the hand in hot water, but it feels warm if it comes after icy 
water. Because they are not independent of perception, relational proper- 
ties dependent on an observer were considered subjective.2 In the language 
of academic philosophy, properties that arise from interactions, especially 
with human observers, are secondary or accidental properties. For that 
very reason, they are also ontologically secondary, their reality derivative. 
In natural philosophy, Kind traditionally refers to natural kinds and 
is often used synonymously with Type and Universals to mean classes of entities or processes def i ned by common primary properties.3 “It’s my [scor- 
pion] nature” follows that reasoning. On this view, kinds and types pick out 
real, universal features in the world. Scorpionality, if you will, is real, the set 
of primary properties that makes scorpions scorpions. The elements of the 
periodic table are prototypes of natural kinds not least because they repre- 
sent measurable and observer- independent properties such as the number of 
protons in the nucleus. All instances of element X have Y number of protons 
in their nucleus. This primary property constitutes their essence. 
It is important to note that, even in classical times, types, kinds, and uni- 
versals were understood to be multiply realized: differently embodied tokens 
can realize the same type. Some actual scorpions are ground dwelling; others 
are tree dwellers, but as scorpions, they possess the same basic primary prop- 
erties. Likewise, whether isosceles, equilateral, or scalene, actual triangles are 
tokens of the type triangularity. They all realize its essential, primary prop- 
erties: three- sided, enclosed, two- dimensional fi gures whose interior angles 
sum to 180 degrees. They would not be triangles if they did not. 
According to Plato, even if material tokens of types ceased to exist, if 
this triangle I drew in the sand got washed away with the tide, the essence 
of triangularity would continue to exist even if no longer instantiated. Pla- 
tonic Forms such as Justice, Goodness, Truth, and Beauty as well as tri- 
angularity and numbers were thought to exist in a transcendental realm, 
fi xed and eternal. They were considered real even if no actual triangles, or 
written numbers, or actual cases of justice, goodness, truth, or beauty had 
ever existed. 
So, Carl Sagan did not get it quite right: Socrates was not entirely deviat- 
ing from the tradition of the pre- Socratics. Platonic dialogues such as the 
Republic (about justice) and Meno (about knowledge acquisition) narrate 
Socrates’ attempts to elucidate and def i ne the universal and eternal essences 
of justice, knowledge, truth, and goodness. Socrates’ efforts to articulate 
the inherent properties of universals are therefore not entirely unlike pre- 
Socratic attempts to discover the essential traits of natural phenomena. 
Because types and forms can be realized in multiple instances or 
tokens, each different from the next, providing a full list of actual realiza- 
tions does not capture a type’s essence; to do so, scholars must discover 
the full set of its primary properties. That is what real (as opposed to 
ostensive) def i nitions do. Even after Plato’s inf l uence gave way to Aristo- 
tle’s, and well before formulating natural laws became the central aim of 
science, classifying natural kinds such as types of rock (igneous, sedimen- 
tary, metamorphic) or biological taxons such as vertebrates by discover-

science and philosophy. It explains how primary properties are considered the ground of reality and the essence of things, as they can exist independently and are objectively measurable. Properties like atomic weight and mass are often cited as primary examples.</p><p>The adoption of an internalist definition of essence led to the dismissal of interactions and relations as contributing nothing fundamental to reality. Context was viewed as an external container and thus irrelevant to identity, which created philosophical conundrums, such as the measurement problem in quantum physics.</p><p>The passage contrasts the seeming ontological independence of primary properties like atomic mass and weight with the context dependence of secondary properties like color and sound. Secondary properties are considered subjective and derivative, arising from interactions, especially with human observers.</p><p>The discussion also involves the concept of kinds and types, which refer to classes of entities or processes defined by common primary properties. Kinds and types are seen as real, universal features in the world, and they can be realized in multiple instances or tokens, each different from the next. Providing a full list of actual realizations does not capture a type's essence; instead, scholars must discover the full set of its primary properties through real definitions.</p><p>The passage mentions Plato's view of Platonic Forms, which exist in a transcendental realm and are considered real even if no actual instances of them exist. It also notes that classifying natural kinds by discovering their primary properties consumed most scientists' time before formulating natural laws became the central aim of science.</p><p>Overall, the passage delves into the distinction between primary and secondary properties, the role of interactions and context in defining identity, and the significance of primary properties in classifying natural kinds and types.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

is ubiquitous, will play a key role in this story. The terms refer to the 
capacity of different events and processes to realize the same function 
or other higher- level property. The main idea presented in this introduc- 
tory chapter is that according to the received understanding of types 
and kinds, individual tokens of a given kind were thought to differ only 
in their secondary properties. Their essential, primary properties, those 
that identify them as a type of thing— a given species, for example— are 
inherent, universal, and unchanging throughout. As late as the nineteenth 
century, this was even thought to be so in nature; Darwin’s proposal that 
new species originated by evolving in response to selection was contro- 
versial for that very reason. *** 
The way philosophers thought about essences and types evolved over the 
course of the history of ideas. As just mentioned, Plato concluded they 
were real transcendent forms. Aristotle, on the other hand, did not agree 
that form and matter could exist independently. In opposition to Plato’s 
disembodied realm of forms, Aristotle focused on embodied Substance, 
the unity of in- formed matter. 
Living things are quintessential examples of Aristotelian in- formed 
matter. In contrast to compacted masses of pebbles, for instance, organisms 
“hang together” in a unique way; they embody or realize a coherence that 
Aristotle postulated as the essence of substance.4 Aristotelean substances 
are also independent existents, the other hallmark of reality for both phi- 
losophy and science.5 On this view, actual lions are the coherent unity of 
the form Lion with the appropriate matter. In comparison to colors, sounds, 
or fl avors, actual lions do not require observers to exist. In lieu of the oth- 
erworldly existence of Plato’s forms, the essence of Aristotelean substances 
was therefore embodied self- suff i ciency. 
From both Plato and Aristotle’s realist perspective, forms and universals 
are real. It was not until later in the history of Western thought that uni- 
versals or types came to be considered mere labels or tools with which we 
think and organize our concepts and actions, or with which we design and 
conduct scientif i c experiments. This perspective, known as nominalism, 
held that the generality of common nouns is our doing; properties that 
def i ne common nouns do not refer to objective essences. In contrast to 
realism, nominalism argued that all that really exists are actual particulars. 
With the rise of scientif i c method in the sixteenth century, observa- 
tion and analysis were elevated over a priori reasoning and synthesis.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

Multiple realizability refers to the capacity of different events and processes to realize the same function or higher-level property.</p><p>In the context of the received understanding of types and kinds, individual tokens of a given kind were believed to differ only in their secondary properties. Their essential, primary properties, which identify them as a specific type of thing (e.g., a species), were considered inherent, universal, and unchanging. This view of fixed and unchanging essences even extended to nature itself, with Charles Darwin's proposal of species evolving through selection being controversial for challenging this notion.</p><p>The passage then traces the evolution of philosophical thought about essences and types.

leader Francis Bacon proposed a new way of reasoning. In contrast to 
medieval Scholasticism’s focus on a priori reasoning, Bacon’s scientif i c 
method was based on induction, on inferring general conclusions from 
fi ne- grained, precise observations. In Discourse on Method a century 
later, French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes laid out a 
technique for knowledge acquisition that returned to deduction. Never- 
theless, it required thinkers to begin with the most elementary and there- 
fore indubitable ideas instead of accepted beliefs or revealed truths. In 
either case (Baconian induction or Cartesian deduction), the proper way 
to acquire knowledge was by starting from the elements (bare observa- 
tions or clear and distinct ideas) and then proceeding to reconstruct the 
whole. 
Threats to coherence are already present in this approach. Before Des- 
cartes, medieval thinkers like Christian Thomas Aquinas, Jewish Moses 
Maimonides, and Muslim Ibn Rushd (Averroes) followed Aristotle in the 
assumption that coherent substance— unity of form and matter— is the 
default basis of reality. What is the source of the coherence of embodied 
substance? Alas, Aristotle’s writings did not fully resolve the question of 
how embodied substance, in- formed matter, is bound into coherent and 
unif i ed wholes (Gill and Lennox 1994). 
In contrast, inf l uenced by modern atomists such as French thinker 
Pierre Gassendi and English experimentalist Robert Boyle, modern sci- 
entists and philosophers prioritized analysis over synthesis, parts over 
the whole. In doing so, the philosophical problem of identity was trans- 
formed from “How does essence in- form matter and confer on it its iden- 
tity?” into “How do primary properties cohere into complex wholes?” 
Whence coherence? Or, more precisely, whence the cause of coherence? 
In Descartes’ writings, Aristotelian embodied substance sundered into 
mind and matter, two distinct ontological domains, each with its own sub- 
stance and each def i ned by its distinct primary property. Mind is def i ned 
by its primary property, res cogitans, whose essential trait is conscious- 
ness, and matter, res extensa, by its primary property, spatial extension. 
Known as dualism, the theory maintained that both substances, mind 
and matter, were real.6 It is unsurprising, therefore, that by the middle 
of the seventeenth century, fears about whether coherence was even pos- 
sible were being voiced. In his famous poem, An Anatomy of the World 
(1611), English poet and soldier John Donne lamented, “Tis all in pieces, 
all coherence gone.”</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Philosophers as far back as Plato were sophisticated enough not to confuse 
form (an entity’s core type identity) with shape. Justice was a Platonic form, 
for example, although it obviously has no shape. If forms are transcendent, 
however, how are actual entities related to the form that makes them what 
they are, that is, that imbues them with their essential nature? 
Plato’s famous allegory of the cave taught that physical objects are 
mere shadows of forms. Over the centuries, explaining how shadows or 
simulacra (material tokens) “partake in” or embody transcendent forms 
became a cottage industry. Plato thought of matter as a corrupting inf l u- 
ence: when ideal forms get mixed in with matter, the result is a degraded 
reality. A few centuries later, and to avoid the Paulist and Augustinian 
disposition to label all matter corrupt after the Fall, Neo- Platonists such 
as Plotinus identif i ed Platonic forms with God and suggested that they 
emanate into matter. Forms somehow ooze into matter?7 Philosophy 
searched for a principle of coherence that binds transcendent forms to 
matter such as to generate coherent wholes. 
The generation and preservation of coherence and its emergent prop- 
erties is the central subject matter of this book. 
Descartes’ proposal that mind and body are two separate and dis- 
tinct substances, each capable of independent existence and character- 
ized by nonoverlapping essences, raised additional questions. Juarrero 
1999 focused on how intentional causation and therefore purposive 
action (as opposed to ref l ex reaction) are even possible. How can two 
substances from entirely different ontological domains, the extended 
physical and the conscious nonphysical, interact at all? How can a non- 
physical event like the intention to do X move the body such that the 
ensuing behavior carries out the content of that intention, doing X? 
Purposive action and the mind– body problem became the crucible of 
coherence. This book focuses on mereological causation, that is, on how 
interacting entities generate wholes with novel properties and how those 
wholes, once they coalesce, guide behavior. In particular, it focuses on 
the manner of causation that generates and preserves parts– whole and 
whole– parts coherence.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Hypotheses about coherent wholeness and its primary and secondary 
properties intersect with views about the status of interactions and rela- 
tions. As noted earlier, context and interactions, including fl uctuations and perturbations, were presumed not to affect essential primary proper- 
ties of fundamental elements or substances. To repeat, whether these consist 
of mass and atomic weight or thought and extension, primary properties 
were allegedly eternal, fi xed, and universal, and they inhered in the entity 
whose essence and identity they underpin. Neither context nor history, not 
to mention process, alteration, or fl ux, could change those fundamental 
building blocks of reality.8 “It’s my nature.” The essence of particles and 
substances (including minds) was internal, remained unaltered despite sec- 
ondary modif i cations, and was capable of separate and independent exis- 
tence. And, as always, relations and interactions with other particles or 
substances were considered neither essential nor foundational. 
*** 
The fi eld of chemistry is all about relations and transformations; chemists 
study interactions among molecules and charged particles. However, if 
relations and interactions are secondary, chemical compounds and chemi- 
cal synthesis cannot then be fully real, qua chemical, as philosophers say. 
They must be nothing but aggregates of primary and essential properties 
of constituent physical elements. Chemical properties must be the acci- 
dental eff l uvia of clumped particles. 
On this view, then, the apparent unity of chemical compounds, or living 
things, is illusory; wholes (including organisms) are mere agglomerations, 
the sum of their elementary parts. Material aggregates do not generate 
coherence; they are just masses of physical stuff. They are nothing but 
macroscopic clumps of elementary particles. They might appear to possess 
qualitatively novel capacities and properties like oxidation, life, sensation, 
and perception or even mind and consciousness. In reality, however, those 
are mere side effects— castoffs— of aggregated masses of primary properties. 
Those seemingly emergent properties and powers are ontologically deriva- 
tive. They bring with them no powers of their own. 
The principle that coherence is nothing but impotent aggregation is still 
presumed to apply generally, not only in chemistry. It motivates the philo- 
sophical perspective called reductionism, often characterized as “nothing 
but- ism.” Reductionism maintains that because wholeness is nothing but 
particles and their secondary interactions, any seemingly novel properties 
of purportedly coherent wholes can be derived, in principle, if not in fact, 
from laws pertaining to its constituent elements. Colloquially, “Wholes are 
nothing but the sum of their parts.” On this view, descriptions of coherence 
are either convenient labels or epistemic simplif i cations to which scien- 
tists resort because computing all the details of micro- interactions among 
primary properties takes too long.

the intersection between views on coherent wholeness and the status of interactions and relations.

nations, transformations, changes, and rearrangements of elements will all 
be fully accounted for by internal, context- independent, and fully quan- 
tif i able, essential— that is, primary— properties of fundamental particles. 
The inevitable conclusion of the foregoing is that seemingly coher- 
ent entities like biological organisms and chemical compounds are caus- 
ally powerless as biological and chemical wholes; if apparently coherent 
“wholes” are mere aggregations, their seemingly emergent properties are 
powerless. In the jargon of philosophy, coherence and emergent proper- 
ties that characterize that apparent coherence are epiphenomenal, that 
is, causally impotent as such. The heavy causal lifting is always and only 
done by the fundamental elementary particles (van Gulick 2004). Accord- 
ingly, the arrow of explanation always looks downward, as the saying 
goes, because reality is grounded in the primary properties of elementary 
particles, which underwrite natural laws. 
In short, misconceptions about causation cut across the previous con- 
siderations. According to the standard physics- based framework, as just 
described, 
• Essences reside in internal and self- suff i cient primary properties capable 
of independent existence. This implies that context and history are not 
fundamental features of reality. 
• “Wholes” that appear to display novel and emergent properties are, 
at bottom, nothing but the sum of those primary properties and their 
interactions. 
It follows that causal powers reside exclusively in fundamental parti- 
cles and their primary properties. Bottom- up inf l uences might bubble up 
from parts to aggregates, but with the following caveats: (1) any apparent 
coherence or wholeness is mere aggregation, and (2) seemingly emergent 
properties such as phenomenal awareness and feelings are, likewise, epi- 
phenomenal characteristics of aggregated elementary particles. 
Specif i cally, according to reductionism, our intuition that mental pro- 
cesses such as intentions and beliefs have powers to actively bring about 
meaningful, purposive actions is illusory. Thoughts, feelings, and inten- 
tions derive their powers and properties from biology; biology from those 
of chemistry; chemistry from physics. Properties that appear unique to 
biological organisms (such as being alive) or human beings (such as sym- 
bolic language) can, in principle, be inferred from chemical processes that constitute them. Causal powers that seem to issue from those higher- level 
properties can be derived from physical properties, at least in principle. It is 
not quite “turtles all the way down,” however. The turtle at the bottom (at 
the level of elementary physics) is special. The primary properties of a- toms, 
reality’s constituents (read now quarks and electrons), are the real and most 
simple stuff that does the causal work and provides explanatory power. 
Ultimate causes reside in and issue from there. Meaning and purpose are 
impotent. 
Such is the dream of a theory of everything, the promise of an equation 
that spells out the lawful correlations among microdetails and from which 
everything else can be derived and precisely predicted. It is this intellectual 
heritage, I submit, that prompts well- known philosophers like Australian 
David Chalmers to espouse double- aspect monism or its close relative, 
panpsychism, the view that even the fundamental constituents of reality 
must have a built- in nonphysical aspect, mentality. Without literally build- 
ing in consciousness into the most basic building blocks of reality from the 
start, hopes of showing how novel properties emerge from material stuff 
are doomed to failure because material stuff can only increase in quantity. 
The Cosmos does not actively create qualitative novelty. Full stop.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

argue that all processes and phenomena in chemistry, biology, psychology, sociology, and ecology can ultimately be fully explained and accounted for by the internal, context-independent, and quantifiable primary properties of fundamental particles. From this perspective, seemingly coherent entities like organisms and chemical compounds are considered causally powerless as wholes, and any apparent emergent properties are deemed epiphenomenal, meaning they have no causal influence.</p><p>According to reductionism, essences are rooted in self-sufficient primary properties capable of independent existence, and context and history are not fundamental aspects of reality. "Wholes" are seen as mere aggregations of their constituent primary properties and interactions. Causal powers are believed to reside exclusively in fundamental particles and their primary properties. Higher-level properties, including mental processes like intentions and beliefs, are considered reducible to lower-level properties, such as chemical or physical processes.</p><p>The reductionist approach envisions a "theory of everything" that would explain all phenomena in terms of fundamental physics. The hope is to derive everything from a set of fundamental equations and predict all aspects of reality precisely. However, this perspective has been criticized for overlooking the potential emergence of new qualities and powers at higher levels of complexity.</p><p>In response to the limitations of reductionism, some philosophers, like David Chalmers, have proposed alternative views, such as double-aspect monism or panpsychism. These views suggest that even fundamental constituents of reality might possess nonphysical aspects, such as consciousness or mentality, which cannot be derived solely from physical properties.</p><p>Overall, the reductionist perspective assumes that causal powers and novel properties are exclusively rooted in fundamental physics, with higher-level phenomena being reducible to lower-level descriptions. However, this perspective faces challenges when addressing the emergence of qualitative novelty and consciousness, leading some thinkers to explore alternative frameworks that incorporate nonphysical aspects.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Eff i cient Causality 
A particular understanding of cause- and- effect relations advanced by 
Newtonian science gave additional support to this worldview. By restrict- 
ing cause– effect relations to eff i cient cause, the ontological status of 
coherent wholes became even more suspect. 
I turn now to the backstory on causality. 
The fi rst systematic treatise of causation was Aristotle’s Physics,9 which 
argued that everything must be explained in terms of four Causes. The fi rst 
three are Material cause, the physical stuff from which something is made; 
Final cause, the purpose or goal the substance brings about; and Formal 
cause, the inherent essence that makes it that kind of substance and no 
other. Consider a potter shaping a pitcher or a carpenter making a chair. 
Material causes of the pitcher and chair are clay and wood, respectively. 
Final causes are pouring liquids and sitting. (In nature, the intrinsic tele- 
ology or fi nal cause of, say, acorns, is to become an oak. Teleology is built 
into nature.) Aristotle illustrated the fourth cause, Eff i cient cause, with 
descriptions of the potter’s hands transforming clay into a pitcher and the 
carpenter’s arm wielding saws or hammers10 on wood. More recently, the preferred illustration of eff i cient causes is cue sticks striking billiard balls. 
Eff i cient causes are energetic forces acting on matter. 
With the advent of modern science and philosophy, fi nal and formal 
causes (which Bacon disparaged as “metaphysics”) could be dismissed 
as “no part of science.” Empiricism held that material cause could be 
accounted for through empirical observation of primary properties, and 
purposive or fi nal cause came to be viewed as an irrelevant leftover from 
the discredited belief that the ultimate drive of all living things is toward 
perfection and God. The ghostly concept of formal cause became otiose 
as nominalism took hold. 
As a result, modern science turned to Aristotle’s eff i cient cause, the 
transfer of energy to matter with which forceful impacts bring about 
effects. After the sixteenth century, the term causality and its cognates 
came to mean exclusively eff i cient cause, the transfer of kinetic energy 
from an agent- cause to a body. Since the advent of Newtonian mechanics 
in the seventeenth century, cause– effect relations have been conceptualized 
solely in terms of motive forces. This perspective was amply rewarded with 
Newton’s Laws of Motion and justif i ably so. I hasten to state unequivo- 
cally that nothing in this work should be taken as a rejection of or argu- 
ment against eff i cient causes or Newtonian science. When calculating 
planetary motions, however, adding a third planet yields a system that is 
chaotic and unpredictable. The laws of motion fail to predict their trajec- 
tories. Newton himself was aware of this so- called three body problem, an 
example of environmental inf l uence completely transforming a system’s 
dynamics. The puzzle was an early hint that context should not be so 
readily dismissed, but modern science and philosophy ignored its warning.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

transfer of energy from one object or agent to another, leading to observable effects. This approach largely disregarded final and formal causes that Aristotle had proposed in his philosophy. Final causes, which refer to the purpose or goal of an entity, were seen as irrelevant and metaphysical, while formal causes, relating to the inherent essence of a substance, became obsolete with the rise of nominalism.</p><p>Efficient causes, on the other hand, took center stage in the scientific worldview, particularly after the development of Newtonian mechanics in the seventeenth century. Newton's Laws of Motion demonstrated the power of understanding cause-effect relations in terms of forceful impacts and energy transfer. These laws were successful in predicting the motion of celestial bodies and many other physical phenomena.</p><p>However, there were early indications that this exclusive focus on efficient causality might have limitations. The three-body problem in celestial mechanics showed that when dealing with complex systems, such as three interacting celestial bodies, the predictability of their trajectories breaks down and becomes chaotic. This highlighted the importance of considering context and interactions among entities, which modern science and philosophy largely overlooked.</p><p>The reductionist perspective, influenced by Newtonian mechanics, often ignores the influence of context, history, and emergent properties in generating coherent wholes. As a result, it can underestimate the significance of relationships, interactions, and feedback loops in shaping the behavior and properties of complex systems. The focus on efficient causality alone might not fully capture the dynamics of interconnected entities and the emergence of new qualities in coherent wholes.</p><p>Thus, the emphasis on efficient causality, while successful in many cases, may not be sufficient to provide a comprehensive understanding of complex systems, emergent properties, and the dynamics of interconnected entities. A more holistic approach that considers all causes, including final, formal, and efficient, as well as the role of interactions and relationships, may be necessary to address the challenges posed by the study of coherence and identity.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">By def i nition, eff i cient causes exist separately from their effects. Relying 
exclusively on this form of causation, however, brought with it other, less 
well- known implications. 
Aristotle’s reasoning about eff i cient causes went as follows: since causes 
and their effects cannot simultaneously exist both before (as cause) and after 
(as effect of) themselves, causes are spatiotemporally “other than” their 
effects. The potter’s actions start before they touch the clay. The motion of 
the cue stick begins before it hits the ball. The potter is spatiotemporally 
distinct from the pitcher; the cue stick is, likewise, “other than” the ball. 
The inevitable conclusion is that self- cause and other forms of “circular 
causality” are impossible because causes and effects would have to exist 
simultaneously: before (as agents) and after (as effects), a contradiction.  Conclusion: the view that reality rests on primary properties of ele- 
mentary particles and that causality is exclusively eff i cient cause is at 
the root of modern science and philosophy’s failure to explain the causal 
powers of systemic properties. Eff i cient causality cannot account for how 
parts become interwoven into interdependencies that bind together coher- 
ent wholes and persist despite turnover or deletion of component parts. 
Much less can it account for top- down causation from the emergent fea- 
tures of coherent wholes to those components or behavior.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

led to certain limitations and implications that were not fully appreciated. According to Aristotle's reasoning, efficient causes and their effects cannot exist simultaneously in the same spatiotemporal location. The cause must precede the effect, and they must be "other than" each other in terms of space and time. For example, the potter's actions start before they touch the clay, and the motion of the cue stick begins before it hits the ball.</p><p>This understanding of efficient causality implies that self-causation and circular causality are impossible. If a cause and effect were to exist simultaneously, it would create a contradiction. This view has influenced the perspective that reality is based solely on the primary properties of elementary particles, and causality is exclusively understood as the transfer of energy from one entity to another.</p><p>However, this exclusive focus on efficient causality falls short in explaining certain aspects of reality, especially in complex systems. It fails to account for how parts become interwoven into interdependencies, forming coherent wholes that persist despite the turnover or removal of component parts. Efficient causality alone cannot fully explain the emergence of systemic properties or how top-down causation operates, where higher-level emergent features of coherent wholes influence the behavior or properties of their constituent parts.</p><p>In complex systems, interactions, relationships, and feedback loops play crucial roles in shaping the behavior and properties of the whole system. The reductionist view that considers only efficient causality may overlook the significance of these higher-order interactions and fail to provide a complete understanding of how coherent wholes maintain their identity and function. To fully comprehend coherence and identity in complex systems, a more comprehensive approach that includes other forms of causality, such as final and formal causes, and recognizes the importance of interactions and relationships is needed.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Mereology 
As noted, philosophers call relations from parts to wholes and wholes 
to parts mereology. According to the default ontological framework 
described (and that is still very much in place), parts cannot interact to 
produce wholes with strongly emergent properties— that is, with proper- 
ties that are not reducible to the sum of the parts. Eff i cient causes produce 
mere aggregates. Emergent characteristics of wholes, as wholes, such as 
coordination and synchronization, cannot inf l uence components because 
they could only do so as eff i cient causes, which is impossible since parts 
and wholes are not spatiotemporally distinct. And since aggregates are 
epiphenomenal, mereological “causation” from clumped particles to com- 
ponents is impossible (Campbell 1974; Kim 1989; Moreno and Mossio 
2016; also see Murphy, Ellis, and O’Connor 2009). These misconceptions 
about mereological relations have occasioned no end of problems, many 
still unrecognized. 
Working from the assumption that all cause is eff i cient cause, therefore, 
philosophers and scientists have resisted the idea of recursive or circular 
causality ever since. The problems of identity and intentional causation 
were perhaps the most insistent philosophical topics that wouldn’t go 
away. Juarrero (1999) chronicled the epicyclic contortions to account for 
purposive behavior while refusing to accept recursive causality. 
How can two separate and distinct substances from different realms 
interact in terms of eff i cient causality? How can mind activate matter? 
Descartes identif i ed the pineal gland as the site where mental events such 
as intentions trigger purposive action. With the advent of thermodynam- 
ics in the nineteenth century, this maneuver ran into a different objection, 
this time involving modern science’s conservation laws and principle of 
physical closure.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

study of relations between parts and wholes. In the default ontological framework, which heavily relies on efficient causality, interactions among parts to produce strongly emergent properties in wholes are considered impossible. Wholes are viewed as mere aggregates of their constituent parts, and any emergent properties they seem to exhibit are considered epiphenomenal, without any causal influence on the components.</p><p>As a result, the idea of recursive or circular causality has been resisted, and philosophers and scientists have struggled to account for purposive behavior without accepting the possibility of such causality. For instance, the problem of how two distinct substances from different realms (e.g., mind and matter) can interact in terms of efficient causality has been a persistent challenge. Descartes proposed that the pineal gland served as the site where mental events (such as intentions) triggered purposive actions in the physical body. However, this notion faced criticism when thermodynamics was introduced in the 19th century, and modern science's conservation laws and principle of physical closure posed a different challenge to the idea of causal interactions between different substances.</p><p>The resistance to recursive causality and the exclusive focus on efficient causality in explaining causation have hindered a more comprehensive understanding of how coherent wholes emerge and influence their component parts. To better grasp the nature of coherence and identity in complex systems, it may be necessary to explore alternative causal frameworks that account for interactions, relationships, and feedback loops among parts and wholes. This could lead to a more holistic view of causation, allowing for a deeper understanding of the emergence of novel properties and behaviors in complex systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Physical Causal Closure and Overdetermination 
Combine an exclusive reliance on eff i cient causality with the First Law of 
Thermodynamics, which holds that that the total amount of matter and 
energy in the universe is fi xed. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed; 
it can be transformed (into energy) and back, but the total amount is always 
conserved. In combination, these two principles lead to a third, causal 
closure of the physical. This principle holds that (1) all states are physical 
states, and (2) all physical states are the effects of physical eff i cient causes. 
The unavoidable implication of these two premises is that proposing that 
the symbolic content of thoughts or beliefs can bring about changes in the 
physical realm violates conservation laws and causal closure. 
The reasoning goes as follows: nonmaterial “causes” such as Aristo- 
telian Formal and Final causes or Cartesian intentions would activate 
bodies by introducing themselves into the physical realm and activating 
them as eff i cient causes. In combination with the resolutely materialist 
presuppositions of the principle of physical closure, this insertion into the 
physical world would increase the universe’s total matter and energy and 
violate conservation in the process. Conclusion: (allegedly) nonphysical 
thoughts, intentions, and other mental events as such cannot bring about 
physical effects without violating causal closure. 
Purposive causation by nonphysical intentions would also imply an 
overdetermined universe, likewise prohibited by causal closure. The argu- 
ment here goes as follows: causal closure requires that all events (includ- 
ing arms rising) be the effects of physical causes— that is, they must result 
from the energy transfer of eff i cient causes. But if intentions are Cartesian 
mental events and my arm rises because I intended to raise it, the result- 
ing behavior is qualitatively different than if my arm rose because of 
an involuntary neuromuscular spasm or because someone pushed me. 
Intentional causation transforms behavior into purposive action, with all 
the legal and moral implications that entails (Murphy and Brown 2007; 
Juarrero 1999). 
But if intentions as meaningful mental states can bring about purpo- 
sive action, the arm motion would be caused by both my intention to 
raise my arm and the neuromuscular processes required by the principle 
of causal closure. Such double causation overdetermines the universe. 
Recall that on the standard understanding of eff i cient causes, causes and 
effects must be logically and spatiotemporally distinct, so on this account, 
intentions must be other than neurophysiological processes, which would 
also violate causal closure.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

closure of the physical, in conjunction with an exclusive reliance on efficient causality and the First Law of Thermodynamics, leads to the conclusion that nonphysical causes, such as mental events or intentions, cannot bring about physical effects without violating conservation laws and causal closure.</p><p>According to causal closure, all states are physical states, and all physical states are the effects of physical efficient causes. If nonphysical causes, like intentions, were to activate bodies and bring about physical effects, they would need to introduce themselves into the physical realm and act as efficient causes. This would imply an increase in the total matter and energy in the universe, contradicting the conservation principle.</p><p>Moreover, intentional causation would imply an overdetermined universe, as both the mental intention and the physical neurophysiological processes would be causally responsible for the same behavior. This violates the principle that causes and effects must be logically and spatiotemporally distinct, as required by the standard understanding of efficient causality.</p><p>Due to these implications, proponents of causal closure and materialist presuppositions have rejected the idea that nonphysical mental events can have causal efficacy in the physical realm. Instead, they seek to explain all behavior and physical effects solely in terms of efficient physical causation, without any role for nonphysical causes.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that this perspective represents a particular philosophical stance and does not encompass all views on causation and the relationship between the mental and the physical. Alternative philosophical frameworks may explore the possibility of nonphysical mental causation or propose more nuanced understandings of the interactions between the mental and the physical realms.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Conclusion: allegedly nonphysical mental events such as intentions, 
thoughts, and beliefs cannot cause actions as meaningful and purposive 
intentions to do X. These considerations reinforced the received view that 
systemic properties are epiphenomenal. 
It follows from this reasoning that postulating top- down (downward) 
causation, from intentions in virtue of emergent mental properties down 
to behavior (Campbell 1974), violates conservation laws and the princi- 
ple of the closure of the physical. Western philosophy’s exclusive reliance 
on eff i cient cause and total dismissal of context bars naturalist accounts 
of mental states and mental causation at the root. By maintaining that 
identity rests on primary properties of fundamental material particles 
(while simultaneously excluding all forms of inf l uence other than eff i- 
cient causality and insisting that relations and interactions with context 
are secondary and epiphenomenal), understanding how mind and body 
could possibly constitute a coherent whole, much less how identity can be 
preserved and persist despite changes, becomes impossible. 
As framed by standard philosophy of science, naturalism closed off 
debate about the causes of coherence and therefore about identity and 
individuation. Without a principle that explains the formation of coher- 
ent wholes from previously separate parts, natural science and philosophy 
of mind were also left without a way of accounting for either mereologi- 
cal relations or interactions with the environment and inf l uence from the 
past. Nothing can generate outcomes that are qualitatively different than 
mere aggregation without violating causal closure. Reductionism followed. 
Human beings are nothing but atoms clumped together in time and space. 
*** 
Over the centuries, several ways of resolving this impasse were proposed. 
The early twentieth century witnessed a fl urry of philosophers who espoused 
an approach labeled emergentism.11 In keeping with the reductionism 
required by natural philosophy, emergent properties were invariably deus 
ex machina contributions, literally injected from outside the physical realm 
into inchoate and passive matter. Emergentists such as French philosopher 
Henri Bergson were often labeled Vitalists in reference to the mysterious 
and externally provided “vital” force that they proposed animates living 
things. Natural scientists summarily ignored these proposals. 
Other thinkers such as Scottish philosopher John Stuart Mill, Australian- 
born philosopher Samuel Alexander, French scientist Henri Poincaré, and 
Austrian biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy cast about for a systems- theoretic 
approach to account for novel properties of wholes. Michael Polanyi tried to have it both ways by arguing that although ultimate boundary conditions were set from without, once in place, they can generate life without outside 
inf l uence. Charles Sanders Peirce, a practicing chemist, knew there was 
something more to chemical compounds than mere aggregation (Juarrero 
and Rubino 2010), but in the end gave up on fi nding an ontological answer 
and, in keeping with Kant’s epistemological turn, settled for a semiotic and 
“pragmaticist” account. 
For the most part, however, the reductionist principle that aggregates 
are nothing but the sum of their parts and that seeming coherent wholes 
such as organisms like you and me are epiphenomenal, powerless to exer- 
cise causality as anything other than masses of atomic primary proper- 
ties, ruled the day. One can sympathize with John Donne’s lamentation 
that all coherence is gone. 
But the problems of coherence and identity did not go away. Intui- 
tively, it is diff i cult to shrug off the belief that there is some logic that 
holds organisms together over time despite perturbations. Organisms are 
organized; they present an internally coherent and persistent “hanging 
together” that is qualitatively different from mere aggregation. What 
makes coherent processes in general, including living things, cohere and 
persist as the same type of entity despite dramatic alterations? Suggest- 
ing, as early complexity theorists proposed in the mid- twentieth century 
(Prigogine and Stengers 1984; Maturana and Varela 1979; Pattee 1972a), 
that constrained and self- organizing dynamics might generate coordina- 
tion and complex organization with qualitatively novel properties went 
completely against the grain of the received framework. With very few 
exceptions (Collier and Muller 1998; Cilliers 1998; Collier and Hooker 
1999), mainstream philosophers of science disregarded complexity. 
Meanwhile, the world moved on. Among the issues raised in identity 
politics today is the role contextual factors such as race, colonialism, class, 
culture, sexual orientation, and age play in personal identity. Environ- 
mental and historical inf l uences are implicated in making all living things 
what and who they are. In biology, the new fi eld of epigenetics has shown 
that the dichotomy between nature and nurture is too simplistic. The 
even more recent research on the metagenome in the gut microbiome, not 
to mention lichens and mycorrhizae, raises even further questions about 
symbiotic wholes. Are human beings more symbiotic wholes than indi- 
vidual organisms? Just asking this begs the question of this book’s central 
theme: what causes coherence? In any case, the physics- based worldview 
from which our understanding of causes and effects, coherence, and iden- 
tity derives continues to assign only secondary or accidental ontological status to context and history. It prioritizes separate and standalone exis- 
tence over relations and interactions.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

surfaced in academic philosophy circles in the early twentieth century. 
Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein and American philoso- 
pher Willard Van Orman Quine independently held that the distinc- 
tion between primary and secondary properties was untenable. As an 
example, there are no necessary and suff i cient primary properties that 
make all games games.12 As students at Oxford University during World 
War II, Philippa Foot, Mary Midgely, Iris Murdoch, and G. E. M. Ans- 
combe argued against the view that reality is wholly transcendent and 
that the faculty of moral intuition is independent of features in the world. 
These remarkable thinkers emphasized instead social, creative, spiritual, 
and biological forms of life as the source and weave of human life. Alas, 
the signif i cance of their ideas is only now being recognized (Lipscomb 
2021; Cumhaill and Wiseman 2022). 
Since the received view of essences and type of entities was predicated 
on primary properties, the next philosophical step was usually a retreat 
to nominalism, the theory mentioned earlier to the effect that any pre- 
tense that types and kinds are real should be abandoned: common nouns 
like triangle or scorpion do not refer to real categories or to real entities 
marked by an internal principle of coherence; they are only linguistic 
units or epistemic cuts that frame our thoughts and investigations. 
Remarkably, even though he was discussing the failure of essentialist 
def i nitions, the later Wittgenstein did not explicitly retreat to nominal- 
ism. He proposed instead that language captures “forms of life,” a phrase 
often interpreted as the opening salvo of a social constructivist approach 
to language. Wittgenstein’s phrase suggests to me, as it did to Anscombe, 
Foot, Midgely, and Murdoch, not an outright retreat from realism but an 
attempt to reimagine the world from the point of view of relations and 
circumstances, context and history. 
An opening to a contextual and relational ontology, in other words. 
Dismissing the inf l uence of context is the original sin whose imprint 
continues to permeate many of these philosophical and scientif i c debates. 
This book will argue that recognizing that context changes everything 
reopens a path toward rehabilitating coherence, identity, and causation— 
from parts to coherent wholes and from emergent coherent wholes to 
parts, including intentional causation. It proposes a realistic and naturalist philosophy based on the principle that nature self- organizes and sorts 
itself into real but contextual coherent dynamics. Call its principle of 
coherence its constraint regime. 
To be consistent, Platonic forms as well as fi nal and formal causes 
must in consequence be reimagined in terms of interactional, extended, 
and context- dependent interdependencies. Thus understood, relational 
types are real and coherent patterns of energy fl ow, structure, and activi- 
ties that form locally from contextually constrained interactions among 
individuals and that, in turn, as coherent dynamics, constrain the indi- 
viduals and circumstances from which they emerge. Reimagining cause- 
and- effect relations, especially mereological relations between parts and 
wholes, and the inf l uence of context and history on those relations, will 
be the hinge on which this reformulation turns. By taking context seri- 
ously in this fashion, coherence and wholeness, as well as meaning, “shall 
be returned.” 
This new interpretive framework makes room for a more expansive 
notion of identity and coherence based on interdependence and charac- 
terized by resilience and robustness. And generated by constraints. 
Even John Donne might approve.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

century saw a shift in academic philosophy circles, with thinkers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Willard Van Orman Quine challenging the dichotomy between essential and accidental properties. They argued that the distinction between primary and secondary properties was untenable, and concepts like types and kinds should not be considered as real entities or categories but as linguistic units or epistemic constructs.</p><p>Other philosophers, such as Philippa Foot, Mary Midgley, Iris Murdoch, and G. E. M. Anscombe, emphasized social, creative, spiritual, and biological aspects of human life as the source and weave of reality, moving away from a wholly transcendent view. These ideas, which recognized the significance of context and relations, were ahead of their time and are now being appreciated more fully.</p><p>Instead of retreating to nominalism, some philosophers, like Wittgenstein, proposed a focus on "forms of life," which could be interpreted as a social constructivist approach to language. This notion suggests a reimagining of the world from the perspective of context and history, opening up a path toward rehabilitating coherence, identity, and causation based on contextual and relational ontologies.</p><p>This book proposes a realistic and naturalist philosophy that recognizes nature's self-organization and coherent dynamics based on contextual constraints. The principle of coherence is seen as a constraint regime, where relational types are real and coherent patterns of energy flow and interactions among individuals that form locally within specific contexts.</p><p>By reimagining cause-and-effect relations, especially mereological relations between parts and wholes, and acknowledging the influence of context and history, this framework offers a more expansive notion of identity and coherence. It emphasizes interdependence, resilience, and robustness, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of reality.</p><p>Overall, taking context seriously and embracing a relational ontology can lead to a more comprehensive and meaningful understanding of coherence, identity, and causation in the natural world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

statement captures an essential aspect of how human cognition works. Our minds do not passively receive raw sensory data from the world; instead, they actively process and interpret that data to construct a coherent representation of reality. This process involves making inferences, filling in gaps, and resolving ambiguities based on prior knowledge, experiences, and mental models.</p><p>Perception is not a direct window to the external world but rather an intricate interplay between sensory input and cognitive processes. Our brain's ability to fill in missing information and make sense of the world allows us to navigate and interact with our environment effectively. However, it also means that our perceptions are influenced by our biases, beliefs, and expectations, potentially leading to cognitive errors and misinterpretations.</p><p>This constructivist view of perception and cognition is a fundamental concept in psychology and philosophy of mind. It helps us understand how our minds actively participate in shaping our reality and how subjective experiences are woven into the fabric of our understanding of the world.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Can you expand on these?

History, and Relations on Understanding Coherence and Identity:
Context, history, and relations play a crucial role in shaping our understanding of coherence and identity. In the traditional reductionist framework, coherence is often viewed as an epiphenomenon or mere aggregation of separate parts without considering the intricate interactions and relations among those parts. However, in a contextual and relational perspective, coherence emerges from the dynamic interplay between elements within a particular context.</li></ol><p>For example, consider a biological organism like a human being. In a reductionist view, a human is seen as a mere sum of its constituent cells and biochemical processes. But in a relational perspective, the identity of a human arises from the intricate web of interactions among cells, tissues, organs, and systems that constitute the living organism. This relational understanding acknowledges the role of context and history in shaping the organism's coherence and identity.</p><ol start="2"><li>Reimagining Causation and Coherence from a Contextual and Relational Perspective:
In the standard reductionist view, causation is often limited to efficient causality, where causes are external forces acting upon passive entities to produce effects. This perspective disregards the idea of circular causality and top-down causation, where higher-level properties of coherent wholes can influence their constituent parts.</li></ol><p>By reimagining causation from a contextual and relational perspective, we open up the possibility of circular and top-down causality. Coherent wholes, such as living organisms or complex systems, can exhibit emergent properties that cannot be solely reduced to the actions of their individual parts. Instead, the interactions and constraints within the context of the whole influence the behavior of the parts, leading to self-organization and emergent phenomena.</p><ol start="3"><li>A Proposal for a Realistic and Naturalist Philosophy Based on Coherent Dynamics and Constraints:
The proposed realistic and naturalist philosophy departs from the reductionist approach and embraces the idea that nature self-organizes into real but contextually constrained coherent dynamics. This perspective recognizes that coherence is not an illusion or epiphenomenon but a genuine emergent property resulting from the interactions and constraints within a system.</li></ol><p>Instead of defining reality solely based on fixed and immutable essences, this philosophy emphasizes the role of context, history, and relations in shaping identity and coherence. It views entities as relational types, patterns of energy flow, and activities that form locally from interactions constrained by the context. These coherent dynamics then reciprocally influence the individual elements and circumstances from which they emerge.</p><p>In this framework, identity and coherence are characterized by resilience and robustness, arising from the constraints that sustain and organize the system. This perspective provides a more holistic understanding of reality, one that acknowledges the active role of context and relations in shaping our world and ourselves. It encourages us to look beyond isolated parts and embrace the interconnectedness of all things.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center

themes or arguments of the book discussed earlier. The phrase emphasizes the importance of context in shaping our understanding of various phenomena, including coherence, identity, causation, and more.</p><p>In the context of the book's discussion, the statement might convey the idea that by considering context, historical factors, and relational perspectives, we gain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of complex systems and their emergent properties. The book likely explores how acknowledging the influence of context and relations can challenge traditional reductionist views and open new paths for understanding reality and philosophy.</p><p>By recognizing the role of context, the book might propose a more realistic and naturalist approach to philosophy, one that embraces the dynamic and interconnected nature of the world, rather than viewing entities as isolated and static. This change in perspective allows us to see that what might appear as mere aggregation or epiphenomena could be genuine emergent properties arising from contextually constrained interactions.</p><p>Overall, the phrase "context changes everything" suggests that by considering the broader context and the interplay of relations, we can develop a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of reality. It encourages us to rethink traditional notions of causation, coherence, and identity and to appreciate the intricate and interconnected nature of the world around us.</p></div></div></div><div

Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence." The title further emphasizes the central theme of the book, which is the transformative power of context in shaping our understanding of coherence and identity.</p><p>The phrase "Context Changes Everything" highlights the importance of considering the broader context, historical factors, and relational perspectives when examining complex systems and emergent properties. It suggests that by taking into account the specific constraints and interdependencies at play, we can gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of how coherence and identity emerge and persist in various phenomena.</p><p>The subtitle "How Constraints Create Coherence" gives a clue to the book's approach, which likely explores how constraints, as shaping factors and limitations, play a fundamental role in creating and maintaining coherent dynamics in the world. The book might propose that coherence is not simply an epiphenomenon or a result of aggregation but is instead generated by specific constraints that influence interactions and relationships among entities.</p><p>Overall, the title "Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence" signals a thought-provoking exploration of how acknowledging context and constraints can revolutionize our understanding of fundamental philosophical concepts and provide a more realistic and naturalistic perspective on the nature of reality.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

context-dependent constraints presented in the book "Context Changes Everything: How Constraints Create Coherence."</p><ol><li><p>Mereology: Mereology is the study of part-whole relationships and is concerned with how individual parts combine to form wholes. In the context of the book's thesis, mereology plays a crucial role in understanding how coherence emerges from the interactions and relationships among individual elements. The book likely explores how coherent wholes are not simply the sum of their parts but are shaped by specific constraints and interactions among these parts. Mereological causation, the causal relationship between parts and wholes, is central to the book's argument about how constraints create and sustain coherence in various systems.</p></li><li><p>Ontology: Ontology is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of being, existence, and reality. In the context of the book, ontology is likely used to explore the fundamental nature of coherence, identity, and causation. The book may present an ontological framework that emphasizes the significance of context in shaping the identities of entities and their coherent dynamics. By reimagining ontology from a contextual and relational perspective, the book likely challenges traditional notions of fixed essences and essential properties, proposing instead a more dynamic and context-dependent understanding of reality.</p></li></ol><p>The thesis about context-dependent constraints is likely to suggest that coherence, identity, and causation are not absolute and unchanging but are contingent on specific contexts, historical factors, and relational interactions. By analyzing the interplay of mereological relationships and ontological considerations within different contexts, the book may offer a new perspective on how constraints influence the emergence, persistence, and evolution of coherent phenomena in the world. It highlights the importance of considering the broader context and relational dynamics when exploring the nature of reality and understanding complex systems.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Summarize: Alvaro Moreno • Matteo Mossio

Matteo Mossio explores the concept of biological autonomy from a philosophical and theoretical perspective. The book delves into the idea of constraints and organizational closure as crucial factors in understanding biological determination and self-constraint. It examines how thermodynamics plays a grounding role in autonomy and introduces Kauffman's work-constraint cycle as a relevant model.</p><p>The authors discuss the relationship between constraints and processes, as well as the transition from self-organization to biological organization. They emphasize the concept of dependence and explore closure as a key characteristic of biological systems.</p><p>The book also addresses the philosophical challenge of emergence and inter-level causation. It discusses irreducibility and non-derivability in the context of emergence and supervenience. The authors respond to the exclusion argument and argue for the importance of constraints and closure as emergent determinations in biological systems.</p><p>Additionally, the book delves into the concept of inter-level causation, investigating the need for nested causation in biology. It considers various perspectives on this matter and draws conclusions about the role of nested causation in biological phenomena.</p><p>Overall, "Biological Autonomy" provides an in-depth examination of the philosophical and theoretical aspects of biological autonomy, including constraints, emergence, and inter-level causation.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

philosophical debate surrounding teleology, normativity, and functionality in biological systems. It explores dispositional approaches and aetiological theories as different perspectives on the purpose and function of biological entities. The authors introduce the concept of the organizational account of functions, which emphasizes teleology, normativity, and self-determination in biological systems. They link closure, organization, and functions, highlighting their implications for understanding biological phenomena such as cross-generation functions and malfunctions.</p><p>Chapter 4: Agency</p><p>Chapter 4 focuses on the concept of agency in biological systems. The authors discuss the definition of agency and differentiate between minimal agency and adaptive agency. They emphasize the specificity of motility as a crucial aspect of adaptive agency. The chapter also explores the notion of autonomy in biological agents and goes beyond individual organisms to consider networks of autonomous agents, with a particular focus on cognition.</p><p>Chapter 5: Evolution: The Historical Dimension of Autonomy</p><p>In this chapter, the authors explore the historical dimension of autonomy through the lens of evolution. They begin with a preliminary look at the origins of Darwinian evolution. The chapter discusses the emergence of replicative molecules and self-maintaining organizations, leading to the emergence of protocells. The authors delve into the origins of natural selection and early forms of template-based evolution. They examine the nature of template constraints and the emergence of specialized template functions. The chapter concludes with a consideration of whether Darwinian evolution is open-ended.</p><p>Chapter 6: Organisms and Levels of Autonomy</p><p>The concept of multicellular organisms and their autonomy is the central theme of this chapter. The authors analyze the evolutionary and organizational views of multicellularity and its relationship to autonomy. They provide a comparative analysis of specific examples like Cyanobacterium Nostoc Punctiforme, Volvox Carteri, and Strongylocentrotus Purpuratus to explore the different levels of autonomy in biological systems. The chapter also discusses the developmental conditions required for highly integrated multicellular organizations and the potential for higher-level autonomy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">7Cognition...................................................................... 167

The authors explore the relationship between agency, particularly motility, and cognition. They discuss how multicellular integration is related to behavioral agency and examine the organizational requirements for complex behavioral agency. The chapter delves into the dynamical decoupling of the nervous system and its evolution. This includes the complexification of the nervous system in relation to body plans and the emergence of autonomic and sensorimotor nervous systems. The appearance of consciousness is also discussed in the context of cognition. The authors highlight cognition's role in the emergence of neurodynamic autonomy and its connections to social interaction.</p><p>Chapter 8: Opening Conclusions</p><p>The final chapter serves as the concluding section of the book. It summarizes the key findings and insights presented throughout the text. The authors reiterate the importance of constraints and organization in understanding biological autonomy. They offer concluding thoughts on the relationship between constraints, coherence, and identity in biological systems and how a contextual and relational perspective can lead to a more realistic and naturalist philosophy. The chapter wraps up with a reflection on the book's contribution to the field of philosophy and theoretical inquiry into biological autonomy.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">Introduction 
Life as Autonomy 
Ifweweretopointoutina fewwordswhatcharacterisesthephenomenonoflife,we 
wouldprobablymentionthe amazingplasticityandrobustnessof livingsystems, the 
innumerableways they adapt,and their capacity to recoverfrom adverseconditions. 
All these capacities have been on the surface of our planet since the origins of 
life, and for this reason we have become accustomed to seeing life as something 
almost “normal”. And yet, looking at it from a more global perspective, life is 
quite an extraordinary phenomenon. In a short period of time (compared to the 
history of the universe), in a very tiny portion of the cosmos, a set of entities 
has managed to attain extremely improbable conf i gurations, to keep them in far- 
from-equilibrium conditions, and to thrive under these conditions: self-organising, 
proliferating, diversifying, and even increasing their complexity. Furthermore, this 
persistently organised system (or, rather, this global system formed by millions 
of local, individualised systems, which combine decay and reproduction) has 
been able to deploy a set of selective forces, modifying its environment so as to 
enhance its own maintenance. In a word, life seems to be at the same time an 
extraordinarily precarious (and improbable) phenomenon and a powerful, robust, 
and easily expansive one. 
Actually,this astonishingcapacityto maintainhighlyorganisedsystems seems to 
be the easiest way to recognise universally living matter beyond the specif i cities of 
terrestrial life. Present-day theories estimate that the universe came into being 13.7 
billion years ago, while our planet was formed approximately 9 billion years later. 
In this period of time, or perhaps later, forms of organisation similar to early living 
systems on our planet possibly appearedin other parts of the universe.Indeed,if life 
appeared on our planet when certain physicochemical conditions were met, other 
planets with similar conditions could also have once supported forms of life. This 
xix 
xxIntroduction 
raises the question of how we could recognise these hypothetical extra-terrestrial 
living systems, and what would be the essential features of any form of (possible) 
life. In the last decades, this question has been widely discussed.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

highlights the extraordinary nature of life as a phenomenon. It emphasizes the plasticity, adaptability, and robustness of living systems, along with their ability to thrive under adverse conditions. Despite life being common on Earth, from a broader perspective, it is a remarkable and improbable occurrence in the universe. Living entities have achieved highly complex configurations, maintained themselves far from equilibrium, and demonstrated self-organization, proliferation, and diversification. Moreover, life has exerted selective forces on its environment to enhance its own maintenance.</p><p>The authors propose that the ability of highly organized systems to maintain themselves is a key universal characteristic of living matter beyond Earth. They suggest that forms of life might have emerged in other parts of the universe under similar physicochemical conditions to Earth. This raises the question of how we could recognize potential extraterrestrial life and what essential features any form of life might possess. The book aims to explore these questions and delve into discussions on biological autonomy and the nature of life itself.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">For some (Cleland and Chyba 2007), it is impossible to say how such “essential 
featuresoflife”shouldbeconceived,becauseweonlyknowlife asit manifestsitself 
onEarth.Yet,ifwhatwemeanby“life”is anymaterialorganisationthathasevolved 
from non-living physicochemical systems (therefore obeying the universal laws of 
physics and chemistry) and has attained at least a degree of complexity capable of 
generating the properties we associate with the simplest forms of terrestrial life, we 
should be capable of recognising it anywhere in our universe, regardless of how 
differently these systems may be constituted (Ruiz-Mirazo et al. 2004).At the same 
time, the huge variety of life forms that have appeared during the very long history 
of life on our planet (Ward and Brownlee 2004) might downplay the argument that 
we havehadaccess onlyto a uniqueexampleoflifeamonga hypotheticallyhugeset 
of extra-terrestrial biological systems. Be that as it may, when facing the question 
of the nature of life, we could not do otherwise than formulate theories based on – 
and tested against – life as we know it. 
It is because of its capacity to achieve and maintain higher degrees of complexity 
that physical sciences i nd it very diff i cult to explain how life has originated. For 
this reason, the question of the origin of life is deeply entangled with the question 
of its very nature. Is there some law or principle in the physical world that allows 
explaining the emergence of life as a necessity or, as Monod (1970) thought, is the 
originof life so unlikelythat it is almost a miracle? How could inert matteroriginate 
something that seems to be so deeply different in its properties? 
From the perspective of the physical sciences, explaining life is a highly 
challengingtask becausethe morecomplexa system is, the less probableit becomes 
both in its appearance and its persistence. At i rst approximation, it might be easy 
to understand how simple building blocks may spontaneously generate composite 
stable structures (atoms, molecules, macromolecules:::) due to different levels of 
forces (Simon 1969): as a result of these interactions, increasingly complex stable 
structures appear (endowed, in many cases, with new interactive properties, not 
present in their separate parts, such as superconductivity, chemical aff i nity:::). 
As the complexity of the structures increases, however, its maintenance becomes 
a problem: thermal noise increases fragility and, moreover, the coincidence or 
coordination of many highly specif i c processes becomes increasingly unlikely. 
It is true that recent advances in thermodynamics explain the formation of 
composite aggregates(called “dissipative structures”), whose parts are tied together 
without intrinsic forces, ensuring their cohesion in far-from-equilibriumconditions. 
However, as we will discuss at length in this book, these systems appear spon- 
taneously and persist only when specif i c external boundary conditions are met 
and, more importantly, they lack internal complexity and functionality. In contrast, 
biology deals with highly complex systems, so that something more than initial 
conditionsandfundamentallaws seemsto berequiredto explainaworldofcomplex 
biological systems. 
Introductionxxi 
Assuming that nature does not make leaps and that, therefore, there is a contin- 
uum between non-living matter and life,1there should be explanatory principles of 
the transition from non-living to living matter. As Fry (2000) has pointed out, the 
fundamental problem of the origin of life lies in the tension between the principle 
of continuity and the diff i culty of explaining the obvious differences between non- 
living and living matter. If the origin of life is a legitimate scientif i c question (and 
we think it is), one should look for a theory that bridges the gap between physics 
and biology. In particular, since living beings are made of the same constituents 
as non-living entities, what is the nature of the organisation that enables them to 
achieve, maintain, and propagate such a high degree of complexity? And what are 
the consequences of this extraordinary capacity?</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

most diverse environments– from the deep oceans or even several kilometres under 
theEarth’scrusttotheupperlevelsoftheatmosphere;fromthehottestenvironments 
(over 100ıC) to extremely acid or radioactive ones. And if we consider life from an 
historical perspective, it is even more impressive how it has managed to adapt to 
the successive catastrophic events that have occurred on our planet during the last 
3.5 billion years. Admittedly, only the simplest forms of life are capable of such 
extreme robustness and versatility; at the same time, these forms of life have also 
been able to innovate and evolve towards increasingly higher levels of complexity. 
Life, as it has developed on our planet, has gradually integrated more and more 
levels of organisation(from unicellular life to colonies, multicellular organisms and 
societies).2 
How can we explain all this diversity and complexity? Ever since Dobzhansky’s 
(1973) famous dictum that “nothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of 
evolution”, mainstream thinking in biology has seen evolution by natural selection 
as the source of diversity at every level of biological organisation. Indeed, the 
unfoldingof an evolutionaryprocess bynatural selection, based onheritable genetic 
mechanisms, allows life to explore many possible combinations and solutions in 
order to survive. And the evolution-centred view of life has been so dominant that 
the idea of organism (which played a key role in nineteenth century biology) has 
becomealmost dispensable(Morange2003).However,in a veryfundamentalsense, 
we shall argue at length that the reality is rather the opposite: evolutionary mecha- 
nisms operate because they are embodiedin the complex organisationof organisms. 
Thus, if we look for the roots of the impressive capacity of life to proliferate, to 
1Philosophically, this assumption amounts to adopting a monistic stance. Chapter. 2 is devoted to a 
detailed analysis of the position of the autonomous perspective developed in this book inthe debate 
on emergence, reduction, and related issues. 
2Nowadays we know that this process of diversif i cation and complexif i cation is not a contingent 
fact, but rather something “inscribed” in the evolutionary nature of life. As Gould (1994) has 
argued, evolution is not aimed towards an increase in complexity; in fact, life originates in the 
simplest form and many organisms have remained successfully as such. However, a few organisms 
occasionally introduced innovations, “thus extending the right tail inthe distribution of complexity. 
Many always move to the left, but they are absorbed within space already occupied”. 
xxiiIntroduction 
create an enormous variety of forms, to adapt to completely different environments, 
and particularly, to increase its complexity, we shall focus on individual living 
entities, namely on organisms, because evolution3as an explanatory mechanism 
actually presupposes the existence of organisms. As Varela (1979) pointed out, 
evolutionary thought, through its emphasis on diversity, reproduction, and the species in 
order to explain the dynamics of change, has obscured the necessity of looking at the 
autonomous nature of living units for the understanding of biological phenomenology. 
Also I think that the maintenance of identity and the invariance of def i ning relations in 
the living unities are at the base of all possible ontogenetic and evolutionary transformation 
in biological systems (p. 5). 
As Rosen also emphasised, the crucial question for understanding life lies in 
the nature of its organisation.4It is true that any known living being cannot 
have appeared except as a result of a long history of reproductive events, since 
such a complex organisation can only be originated through an accumulative 
historical process and, furthermore, that its long-term sustainability also requires 
inter-generational entailments. This is clearly ref l ected in the fact that, in order 
to be operational, genetic components (which contribute to specify the metabolic 
machinery and organisation of single biological entities) must be shaped through a 
process that involves a large number of individual systems and many consecutive 
generations, or reproductive steps. Yet, this does not mean that the organisation 
of organisms should be neglected; on the contrary, a theory of living organisation 
is fundamental for understanding how these evolutionary mechanisms could have 
appeared and how they could work.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

of the central role played by the notion of organism in biology should be placed 
within this wider perspective, in which the explanatory emphasis is placed on 
organisation. As Hooker and Christensen (1999) have highlighted, in order to 
3The term ‘evolution’ could be understood in a very broad sense, just as an historical process of 
causal entailments. However, since Darwin, the term evolution has acquired a more restrictive 
sense, referring to specif i c mechanisms of inheritance and several other conditions (see for 
example, Godfrey-Smith (2009)). We will discuss the relation between autonomy and evolution 
in Chap. 5; here, we use the more restrictive sense of the term. 
4“We cannot answer the question (:::) ‘Why is a machine alive?’ with the answer ‘Because its 
ancestors were alive’. Pedigrees, lineages, genealogies, and the like, are quiteirrelevant to the basic 
question. Ever more insistently over the past century, and never more so than today, we hear the 
argument that biology is evolution; that living systems instantiate evolutionary processes rather 
than life; and ironically, that these processes are devoid of entailment, immune to natural law, and 
hence outside of science completely. To me it is easy toconceive of life, and hence biology, without 
evolution” (Rosen 1991: 254–55).

properlyunderstandtheevolutionofbiologicalsystems, traditionalapproachesneed 
to be embedded within a more general dynamical-organisationaltheory.5 
Therefore, it is at the level of organisms, understood as cohesive and spatially 
bounded entities, that the biological domain’s organised complexity is fundamen- 
tally expressed. Seen from the perspective of their relations with their environment, 
individual organisms are systems capable of acting for their own benef i t, of 
constituting an identity that distinguishes them from their environment (at the same 
time as they continue interacting with it as open, far-from-equilibrium systems). 
This capacity of living beings to act for their own benef i t follows from their peculiar 
form of organisation. 
Living beings are systems continuously producing their own chemical compo- 
nents, and with these components they build their organs and functional parts. In a 
word, their organisation is maintaining itself. This is why living systems cannot 
stop their activity: they intrinsically tend to work or they disintegrate. Actually, 
this inherent tendency of living entities to promote their own existence – to act 
on their own behalf – could be related to the idea of the conatus, to which Spinoza 
(1677/2002) refers to designate the innate inclination of any entity to continue to 
exist and enhance itself.6</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

Jonas (1966/2001) pointed out, the organisation of living systems is characterised 
by the inseparability between what they are – their “being” – and what they do – 
their “doing”. This feature is ref l ected in their metabolism, which consists of a 
set of processes that allow them to build and replace their structures, grow and 
reproduce, and respond to their environments. Metabolism is the ongoing activity 
by which living beings continuously self-produce (and eventually, re-produce), 
self-repair, and maintain themselves. Unlike the Cartesian argument (which has 
had so much inf l uence during modernity7) that living beings are like man-made 
machines, Kant was the i rst author who defended the view that organisms are 
5As a matter of fact, an organisational perspective seems to be taking shape in the new evolutionary 
developmental biology, which studies how the dynamics of development determine the phenotypic 
variation arising from genetic variation and how this affects phenotypic evolution (Laubichler and 
Maienschein 2007). 
6AsSpinoza (1677/2002) writes, “Each thing,insofar asitisinitself, endeavors topersist initsown 
being” (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6). This is understood as an intrinsic tendency or force to continue to 
exist. Striving to persevere is not merely something that a thing does in addition to other activities 
it might happen to undertake. Rather, striving is “nothing but the actual essence of the thing itself” 
(Ethics, part 3, prop. 7). See Duchesneau (1974) for an in-depth analysis of Spinoza’s account of 
living systems, and a comparison with the Cartesian one. 
7Actually, the Cartesian distinction between res extensa and res cogitans, which subsumed the 
biological domain within a global mechanistic vision of nature, facilitated a scientif i c research 
programme for studying living systems. It should be underscored that, while Descartes’ metaphys- 
ical dualism is widely recognised and is a prominent feature of his Meditations, scholars in the 
past generation have also focused on the complexity of his natural philosophy, including his work 
in physiology, medicine but also on the passions, as displaying something very different: a more 
‘integrated’ view of bodily function. See notably the essays collected in Gaukroger et al. (2000). 
xxivIntroduction 
deeply different from machines because their parts and activities are non-separable, 
and the functions of these parts are not externally imposed, but rather intrinsically 
determined. According to Kant (1790/1987), since the activity performed by the 
parts of the organism is carried out for their own maintenance, organisms are 
intrinsically teleological. As he writes in the Critique of Judgement: 
In such a product of nature each part, at the same time as it exists throughout all the others, 
is thought as existing with respect to the other parts and the whole, namely as instrument 
(organ). That is nevertheless not enough (because it could be merely an instrument of art, 
and represented as possible only as a purpose in general); the part is thought of as an organ 
producing the other parts (and consequently each part as producing the others reciprocally). 
Namely, the part cannot be any instrument of art, but only an instrument of nature, which 
provides the matter to all instruments (and even to those of art). It is then – and for this 
sole reason – that such a product, as organized and organizing itself, can be called a natural 
purpose (CJ, § 65). 
This view allows him to open up a gap in the physical world, since organisms 
cannot be brought under the rules that apply to all other physical entities. Thus, 
Kant asks himself: 
How purposes that are not ours, and that we also cannot attribute to nature (since we do not 
assume nature to be an intelligent being) yet are to constitute, or could constitute, a special 
kind of causality, or at least a quite distinct lawfulness of nature (CJ, § 61).</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1

Both scaffolds and ratchets are mechanisms or structures that assist in specific processes or functions.</p><ol><li><p>Scaffolds: In biology, scaffolds are temporary or permanent structures that provide support and structure for cells during tissue regeneration or growth. They act as frameworks upon which cells can attach, migrate, and organize themselves to form new tissues or organs. Scaffolds can be made from various materials and are used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine to promote the development of new tissues in the body.</p></li><li><p>Ratchets: In physics and engineering, a ratchet is a mechanical device that allows motion in one direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. It typically consists of a toothed wheel or bar that engages with a pawl, allowing the wheel to move in one direction but preventing it from moving back. Ratchets are used in various applications, such as in wrenches or gears, to convert back-and-forth motion into unidirectional rotation.</p></li></ol><p>The similarity between scaffolds and ratchets lies in their function of facilitating specific processes or actions. Scaffolds provide a supportive framework for cellular activities, while ratchets enable unidirectional movement or rotation. Both structures assist in achieving particular goals within their respective domains, making them valuable tools in different fields. However, it's important to note that their underlying principles and mechanisms are distinct, with scaffolds involving biological and material interactions, whereas ratchets are based on mechanical and engineering principles.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

such as chemistry, psychology, and social sciences. Let's explore each of these terms:</p><ol><li><p>Buffers:
In chemistry, a buffer is a solution that helps maintain the pH (acidity or alkalinity) of a system relatively stable, even when an acid or a base is added. Buffers are essential in various biological processes because they prevent rapid and extreme changes in pH, which could be harmful to living organisms. Buffers typically consist of a weak acid and its conjugate base or a weak base and its conjugate acid. When an acid is added to a buffer, the base component of the buffer neutralizes it, and when a base is added, the acidic component of the buffer neutralizes it, helping to keep the pH within a specific range.</p></li><li><p>Entrenchment:
Entrenchment refers to the process by which something becomes firmly established or deeply ingrained over time. In psychology and cognitive science, entrenchment often pertains to the formation of strong mental associations or habits as a result of repeated experiences or exposure. For example, certain beliefs or cognitive biases can become entrenched in individuals' thinking due to frequent exposure or reinforcement from their social or cultural environment. Entrenched beliefs or habits may be challenging to change because they have become deeply rooted in one's cognitive processes.</p></li><li><p>Catalysts:
In chemistry, a catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed in the process. Catalysts work by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur, thus speeding up the reaction. They facilitate the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, enabling reactions that might otherwise be slow or unfeasible. Catalysts play a crucial role in various industrial processes, biological reactions, and environmental processes.</p></li></ol><p>Each of these concepts highlights different aspects of how systems maintain stability, develop patterns, or undergo change in various domains of science and everyday life. Buffers ensure stability in chemical reactions, entrenchment influences the formation of beliefs and habits, and catalysts accelerate reactions and transformations.</p></div></div></div><div

fascinating phenomenon observed in non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. Prigogine's work in the 1960s and 1970s revolutionized our understanding of complex systems and their behavior far from thermodynamic equilibrium.</p><p>In classical thermodynamics, systems tend to reach a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the distribution of energy and matter is uniform and unchanging over time. However, many real-world systems are open, exchanging energy and matter with their surroundings, and are often far from equilibrium. Prigogine's research focused on understanding how these open systems could self-organize and exhibit novel behaviors and structures.</p><p>Key points about dissipative structures:</p><ol><li><p>Far-from-equilibrium behavior: Dissipative structures emerge in systems that are continuously exchanging energy and matter with their environment and are driven by energy gradients. These systems are called far-from-equilibrium systems.</p></li><li><p>Self-organization: In these far-from-equilibrium conditions, dissipative structures spontaneously form and organize themselves into coherent patterns. These patterns are maintained and sustained through continuous energy flow.</p></li><li><p>Entropy production: In non-equilibrium systems, the second law of thermodynamics still holds, stating that the total entropy (a measure of disorder) of an isolated system will always increase. However, in open systems, the local entropy can decrease or remain constant, as long as the total entropy production (system plus its environment) increases.</p></li><li><p>Stability through flow: Dissipative structures are sustained by the continuous flow of energy and matter through the system. These flows allow the system to maintain a delicate balance between order and disorder, enabling the persistence of the coherent patterns.</p></li></ol><p>Examples of dissipative structures include convection cells in fluids, chemical oscillations, and spiral patterns in reaction-diffusion systems. One of the most famous examples is the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, a chemical reaction that exhibits periodic oscillations in color and concentration, forming striking patterns in a Petri dish.</p><p>Prigogine's work on dissipative structures and non-equilibrium thermodynamics has had a profound impact on various scientific fields, from physics and chemistry to biology, ecology, and the study of complex systems. It has provided insights into understanding self-organization, emergence, and the dynamics of complex systems in nature.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div

several connections with the previous topics discussed, such as the nature of life, biological autonomy, and the role of context and constraints in understanding complex phenomena. Here are some of the connections:</p><ol><li><p>Biological Autonomy: The idea of dissipative structures is relevant to the concept of biological autonomy. Living organisms are open systems, far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and they continuously exchange energy and matter with their environment to maintain their structure and function. The emergence of dissipative structures in living systems plays a crucial role in their ability to self-organize and maintain their autonomy.</p></li><li><p>Constraints and Self-Organization: The study of dissipative structures emphasizes the role of constraints in self-organization. These structures form and persist due to specific constraints imposed by the continuous energy flow and exchange with the environment. Constraints play a critical role in shaping the behavior and dynamics of complex systems, including living organisms.</p></li><li><p>Emergence and Complexity: Dissipative structures exemplify emergent phenomena, where complex patterns and behaviors arise from the interactions of simple components. The emergence of coherent structures in dissipative systems provides insights into how complexity can arise in living systems and other complex systems in nature.</p></li><li><p>Reimagining Causation: The study of dissipative structures challenges traditional notions of causation, especially in non-linear and far-from-equilibrium systems. The emergence and stability of dissipative structures are not solely determined by external causes but depend on the system's internal dynamics and interactions with its environment.

causes but, at the same time, generate them. The very organisation of living beings, 
in which the parts generate the whole, and, conversely, the whole produces and 
maintains the parts, shows a kind of intrinsic purpose. Kant grounds the idea of 
purposiveness (and teleology) in the holistic and circular organisation of biological 
organisms and, more precisely, in the fact that they are able to organise by 
themselves, to self-organise.8Unlike artefacts, organisms are “natural purposes”: 
they are not produced or maintained by an external cause, but instead have the self- 
(re)producing and self-maintaining character that is revealed in the kinds of vital 
properties they display (reciprocal dependence of parts, capacity for self-repair and 
self-(re)production). 
Today, some aspects of the Kantian perspective are undergoing resurgence. For 
example, the recent blossoming of systems biology (Kitano 2002; Science, special 
issue 2002; Bogeerd et al. 2007), focused on the complexity of biomolecular 
interaction networks, is much closer to a holistic or integrative conception of living 
systems than the reductionist views predominant in molecular biology. Thanks 
to the development of new scientif i c tools, these more holistic theories place the 
question of the organisation at the centre of biological research. This recent trend 
contrasts with the preceding history of biology, during which the Kantian view 
has often be seen as marginal (even through this view has been corrected by 
8Actually, Kant has been one of i rst authors to use the term “self-organisation”. In Chap. 1, we 
will brief l y mention how the meaning of this concept has progressively shifted during the 20th 
century. 
Introductionxxv 
the recent historiography, see for instance Huneman 2007; Richards 2000; Sloan 
2002), essentially because it was thought to be at odds with the model of causality 
predominant in Newtonian science. 
And yet, the Kantian perspective had continuity in the (mostly Continental) 
Biology of the nineteenth century, especially in the work of Goethe and Cuvier 
(Huneman 2006). In the i rst part of the twentieth century, many biologists were 
still convinced that the nature of living organisation – understood, following Kant’s 
inspiration, as the form in which the parts interact with each other to bring forth 
the properties of the whole – was one of the main issues of biology. This view 
was commonlylabelled organicism (Wolfe 2010;see also Gilbert and Sarkar 2000). 
Organicism considers the observable structures of life, its overall organisation, and 
the properties and characteristics of its parts to be the result of the reciprocal 
interplay among all its components. The organicist tradition was inf l uential in early 
twentieth century biology. During the twenties and thirties, a group of researchers, 
including Woodger, Needham, Waddington, and Wrinch, created the “Theoretical 
Biology Club”, whose objective was precisely to promote the organicist approach 
to biology. This movement – in which we can include other authors, like Bernal 
and Bertalanffy – was characterised by a predominant anti-reductionist and holistic 
inspiration (Etxeberria and Umerez 2006). Among these researchers, the name of 
Waddington is worth stressing because his work, after the Second World War, 
permitted the connection between the organicist movement of the thirties and the 
new tendencies of the sixties and seventies. 
To understand the roots of the current blossoming of the “Kantian-inspired 
organicist ideas” in biology during the twentieth century, let us mention some other 
scientif i c trends, falling outside the frontiers of biology.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

revival of holistic and organicist ideas in modern biology are connected to the broader themes of the book "Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and Theoretical Enquiry." Here are some of the connections:</p><ol><li><p>Biological Autonomy: Kant's idea of self-organization and teleology in living beings aligns with the concept of biological autonomy explored in the book. The notion that living organisms can self-organize, maintain their identity, and act for their own benefit is central to understanding biological autonomy and the distinctive features of living systems.</p></li><li><p>Organismic View: The organicist tradition, as discussed in the book, highlights the importance of the reciprocal interplay among the components of living systems in shaping their overall organization. This perspective rejects reductionism and emphasizes the holistic nature of biological phenomena.</p></li><li><p>Context-Dependent Constraints: The idea of self-organization and purposiveness in living systems resonates with the book's exploration of context-dependent constraints. Kant's view of teleology in organisms and the organicist approach emphasize the significance of internal and external context in understanding the behavior and organization of living entities.</p></li><li><p>Evolution and Complexity: The revival of holistic and organicist ideas in modern biology, as mentioned in the book, connects to the discussions on evolution and complexity. The focus on organization, self-organization, and teleology complements the traditional evolutionary perspective, providing insights into the emergence and maintenance of complex biological structures and functions.</p></li><li><p>Systems Biology: The modern trend of systems biology, which looks at the complexity of biomolecular interaction networks, is closely related to the organicist ideas discussed in the book. Systems biology emphasizes the organization and dynamics of biological systems as a whole, considering the interactions and feedback loops among their components.</p></li><li><p>Non-Mechanistic Causality: Kant's circular causality and the organicist view challenge the traditional mechanistic model of causality in Newtonian science. These perspectives provide alternative ways of understanding causation in living systems, focusing on the inherent purposiveness and self-organization in biological phenomena.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the exploration of Kantian teleology, organicist ideas, and their resurgence in modern biology enriches the discussion on biological autonomy, self-organization, and the dynamic nature of living systems. It highlights the need to consider the organization and context of living entities to fully understand their behavior, functions, and evolution.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">First, during the thirties and forties, a number of physicists associated with the 
development of quantum theory, interested in the nature of biological organisation, 
turned their attention to biology. Among these scientists, it is worth emphasising 
the name of Schrödinger, who gave his famous lectures “What Is Life?” in 1943 
(Schrödinger 1944). Following this work, other quantum physicists addressed the 
problem of what characterises the specif i city of living systems with regard to 
physical ones. Among these we can include researchers like von Neumann and 
Pauli. Interestingly, the advances in physics inspired new attempts to challenge 
reductionist assumptions. For example, Rashevsky, according to his disciple Rosen, 
defended 
a principle that governs the way in which physical phenomena are organized, a principle 
that governs the organization of phenomena, rather than the phenomena themselves. Indeed, 
organization is precisely what relational biology is about (Rosen 1991: 113). 
During the seventies, Rosen himself and Pattee (Umerez 2001) also developed 
an anti-reductionist view of the specif i c organisationof living systems, based on his 
analyses of the specif i c causation associated with emergent constraints that living 
systems generate (see further below). 
Second, special emphasis should be put on the cybernetic movement. The 
cyberneticists were inf l uenced by the work of the American physiologist Cannon 
xxviIntroduction 
(1929) who, in the early 1930s, developed the concept of “homeostasis” (whose 
origins date back to the work of the French biologist Claude Bernard9) as a key 
feature of the organisation of living beings. According to Cannon, the idea of 
homeostasis expresses the tendency of living systems to actively maintain their 
identity, despite external perturbations or differences within their environment. 
During the 1970s, a new generation of cyberneticists, notably Von Förster, Ashby, 
and Maturana, created the so-called second-order cybernetics. This movement was 
especiallyinterestedin the study andmathematicalmodellingofbiologicalsystems, 
basedontheideasofrecursivityandclosure(CahiersduCREA1985).Second-order 
cyberneticsis of special relevancefor ourpurposes,since it constitutedthe scientif i c 
environment in which the theory of autopoiesis was elaborated (see below). 
Third, after the work of Prigogine (1962), the idea of self-organisation in far- 
from-equilibrium conditions began to enter into scientif i c discourse in physics, 
which also helped the Kantian view to gain inf l uence in biology. Yet, as we will 
discuss at length in Chap. 1, there is an important conceptual difference between 
the Prigoginian concept of (physical) self-organisation and the Kantian notion 
of (biological) organisation. As Fox Keller (2007) has pointed out, the kind of 
complexity of organisms resulting from an iterative processes of organisation that 
occur over time is completely different from the one-shot, order-for-free kind of 
self-organisation associated with some kind of non-linear dynamical systems. In 
particular,theformerisconstitutedbyfunctionalparts,whereasthelatterlacksfunc- 
tionality. The logic of the metabolism, for example, shows a functionallydiversif i ed 
organisation, clearly different in this sense from any physicochemical dissipative 
structure. In this sense, as we will see, what we need is a view of biological systems 
that goes beyond a generic vindication of an organisational-centred biology. What 
matters is the understanding of the specif i city of the organisation of biological 
systems, which are not just self-organised systems.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

explored in the book "Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and Theoretical Enquiry." Here are some connections:</p><ol><li><p>Quantum Physics and Biology: The influence of quantum physicists like Schrödinger, von Neumann, and Pauli on the study of biological organization connects to the book's exploration of self-organization and autonomy in living systems. The ideas from quantum physics opened up new perspectives on the nature of living beings, prompting researchers to question reductionist assumptions and investigate the specificity of biological organization.</p></li><li><p>Cybernetics and Homeostasis: The cybernetic movement's focus on homeostasis and the study of biological systems as self-regulating and self-maintaining entities resonates with the book's emphasis on biological autonomy. Homeostasis, as the tendency of living systems to actively maintain their identity, aligns with the concept of autonomy and self-organization explored in the book.</p></li><li><p>Prigogine's Self-Organization: Prigogine's work on self-organization in far-from-equilibrium conditions connects to the broader discussion of self-organization in living systems. While the book distinguishes between physical and biological self-organization, the concept of self-organization as a process of iterative organization over time is relevant to understanding the complexity and functional diversity of living organisms.</p></li><li><p>Second-Order Cybernetics and Autopoiesis: The development of second-order cybernetics and the theory of autopoiesis align with the book's exploration of the specific organization of living systems. Second-order cybernetics, with its focus on recursive and self-referential processes, provides insights into the nature of autonomy and self-maintenance in living entities.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the historical developments and scientific movements mentioned in the book contribute to the understanding of the nature of biological organization, the concept of autonomy, and the specific features that distinguish living systems from non-living ones. These perspectives offer valuable insights into the study of life as a complex and self-organizing phenomenon, highlighting the importance of organization and context in understanding biological phenomena.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">In the second post-war period, both the New Synthesis in evolutionary biology 
and the revolution of Molecular Biology created a scientif i c atmosphere that was 
quite unprepared to accept organicist and Kantian views (Moreno et al. 2008). 
Accordingly,this tradition remained, until very recently, marginalin biology.In this 
context, however, Waddington was the main driver of a movement that advocated 
an organisationalapproachin biology,by revivingthe “f i rst” TheoreticalBiology of 
the twenties and thirties (Etxeberria and Umerez 2006). This “second” Theoretical 
Biology was initially developed by several pioneering authors like Waddington 
himself (1968–1972), Rosen (1971, 1972, 1973, 1991), Piaget (1967), Maturana 
and Varela (1980), Pattee (1972, 1973), and Ganti (1973/2003, 1975). Many of 
these authors put strong emphasis on the idea that the constitutive organisation 
of biological systems realises a distinctive regime of causation, able not only 
of producing and maintaining the parts that contribute to the functioning of the 
system as an integrated, operational, and topologically distinct whole but also able

Introductionxxvii 
to promote the conditions of its own existence through its interaction with the 
environment. This is essentially what we call in this book biological autonomy. 
To give a preliminary idea of what autonomy is about, let us mention one 
of its i rst and well-known accounts, the theory of autopoiesis proposed by the 
Chilean biologists Maturana and Varela in the early 1970s (Maturana and Varela 
1973; Varela et al. 1974). In the theory of autopoiesis, although the concept of 
autonomyis appliedto differentspecif i c biologicaldomains(immune,neural:::see 
Varela 1979), it characterises the fundamental feature of the living, namely, the 
autopoietic organisation. Autopoiesis refers to the capacity of self-production of 
biological metabolism, by emphasising (in a simplif i ed and abstract way) its causal 
circularity – which Maturana and Varela called “operational closure”. In particular, 
their model describes the production of a physical boundary, which is conceived 
as a condition of possibility of the internal chemical network (because it ensures 
suitable concentrations for the maintenance of the component production network); 
in turn, the network maintains the physical boundary (because it is the component 
production network which produces the special self-assembling components that 
build the membrane). In their own terms (in which the cybernetic l avour is 
manifest): 
An autopoietic machine is a machine organized (def i ned as a unity) as a network of 
processes of production (transformation and destruction) of components which: (i) through 
their interactions and transformations continuously regenerate and realize the network of 
processes (relations) that produced them; and (ii) constitute it (the machine) as a concrete 
unity in space in which they (the components) exist by specifying the topological domain 
of its realization as such a network (Maturana and Varela 1980: 78). 
Thus, autopoiesis consists in a recursive process of component production that 
builds up its own physical border. The global network of component relations 
establishes self-maintaining dynamics, which bring about the constitution of the 
system as an operational unit. In short, physical border and metabolic processes are 
entwined in a cyclic, recursive production network and they together constitute the 
identityofthesystem.Fromthisperspective,phenomenaliketornadoes,whirlpools, 
andcandlef l ames,whicharetoacertaindegreeself-organisingandself-maintaining 
systems, are not autonomous, because they lack an internally produced physical 
boundary, and are not concrete topological units. In that sense, what distinguishes 
self-organisation from autonomy is that the former lacks an internal organisation 
complex enough to be recruited for deploying selective actions capable of actively 
ensuring the system’s maintenance.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button

Synthesis in evolutionary biology and the revolution of Molecular Biology during the post-war period created a scientific climate that was not receptive to organicist and Kantian views in biology. As a result, the organizational approach remained marginalized in the field until more recently. However, Waddington played a significant role in reviving interest in the organizational approach by drawing inspiration from the Theoretical Biology movement of the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p>The "second" Theoretical Biology, developed by pioneering authors like Waddington, Rosen, Maturana, Varela, Pattee, and Ganti, emphasized the idea that the constitutive organization of biological systems gives rise to a distinctive regime of causation. This organization not only maintains the system as an integrated whole but also promotes the conditions of its own existence through its interactions with the environment. This concept of biological autonomy was fundamental to this approach.</p><p>One of the early and well-known accounts of biological autonomy is the theory of autopoiesis proposed by Maturana and Varela in the early 1970s. Autopoiesis refers to the capacity of self-production in biological metabolism, with a focus on the causal circularity of the process, referred to as "operational closure." The system produces its own physical boundary through a recursive process of component production, and this boundary, in turn, maintains the metabolic processes. Autopoiesis is a key feature that distinguishes living systems from other self-organizing systems like tornadoes, whirlpools, and candle flames. While these phenomena exhibit self-organization to some extent, they lack the internally produced physical boundary and concrete topological unity that characterizes biological autonomy.</p><p>The notion of autonomy in biological systems, exemplified by autopoiesis, highlights the active and self-maintaining nature of living beings. The book "Biological Autonomy: A Philosophical and Theoretical Enquiry" likely delves deeper into these ideas, exploring the specific characteristics of autonomy in living systems and its implications for understanding the nature of life.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">For the purposes of this book, it is worth mentioning two lines of criticism that 
have been addressed to the theory of autopoiesis. On the one hand, autopoiesis 
conceives autonomy as a fundamental internal determination, def i ned by the 
operational closure between the production network and the physical border. In this 
model,interactionswiththeenvironmentdonotenterintothedef i nition-constitution

xxviiiIntroduction 
def i ne autonomy in rather abstract and functionalist terms: material and energetic 
aspects are considered as purely contingent to its realisation. 
On both these issues, the framework that we will develop in this book takes 
a different path. The autonomous perspective, we hold, should take into account 
the “situatedness” of biological systems in their environment, as well as their 
“grounding” in thermodynamics. As a matter of fact, these issues have been at the 
centre of the most recent studies on biological autonomy, by authors like Hooker, 
Collier, Christensen, Bickhard, Kauffman, Juarrero, and the IAS Research Group,10 
who have stressed that the interactive dimensions of autonomous systems in fact 
derive from the fact that they are thermodynamically open systems, in far-from- 
equilibrium conditions. As these authors have explained, since the constitutive 
organisation of biological systems exists only in far-from-equilibrium conditions, 
they must preserve an adequate interchange of matter and energy with their 
environment or they would disintegrate. For example, in Kauffman’s approach, the 
main condition required for considering a system autonomous is that it should be 
capable of performing what he calls “work-constraint cycles” (Kauffman 2000). As 
MaturanaandVarela,Kauffman’saccountenvisageshowautonomycancomeoutof 
thecausal circularityof thesystem; yet,in his view,this circularityis understoodnot 
just intermsofabstract relationsofcomponentproductionbutin explicitconnection 
with the thermodynamic requirements that the system must meet to maintain itself. 
In accordance with this literature, we will make in this book a conceptual 
distinction between two interrelated, and yet conceptually distinct, dimensions of 
biological autonomy: the constitutive one, which largely determines the identity of 
the system; and the interactive one, which, far from being a mere side effect of 
the constitutive dimension, deals with the inherent functional interactions that the 
organisms must maintain with the environment (Moreno et al. 2008). These two 
dimensions are intimately related and equally necessary. It might be illuminating 
to think of the example of the active transport of ions across the cell membrane, 
required to prevent osmotic crises. The cell can be maintained as long as ion 
transport is performed, but this interaction can only be carried out because there 
is a constitutive chemical organisation providing the membranous machinery that 
does the work. In particular, the emphasis on the interactive dimension implies, as 
we will stress repeatedly,that autonomyshould not be confusedwith independence: 
an autonomous system must interact with its environment in order to maintain its 
organisation11(Ruiz-Mirazo and Moreno 2004). As we will discuss in Chap. 4, this 
is what grounds the agential dimension of autonomy.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2

Firstly, it defines autonomy as a fundamental internal determination, primarily characterized by the operational closure between the production network and the physical boundary of the system. This view does not consider the interactions with the environment as integral to the constitution of the autonomous system; instead, such interactions are seen as a consequence of the system's internal identity. Secondly, the theory of autopoiesis defines autonomy in abstract and functionalist terms, largely disregarding the material and energetic aspects that are contingent on its realization.</p><p>In contrast to the autopoiesis framework, the perspective developed in this book takes a different path. The autonomous perspective presented here considers the "situatedness" of biological systems within their environment and their grounding in thermodynamics. Recent studies on biological autonomy by various authors have emphasized that the interactive dimensions of autonomous systems stem from their status as thermodynamically open systems in far-from-equilibrium conditions.</p><p>The distinction between two interconnected, yet conceptually distinct, dimensions of biological autonomy is introduced: the constitutive dimension and the interactive dimension. The constitutive dimension largely determines the identity of the system, while the interactive dimension deals with the functional interactions that the organism must maintain with its environment. Both dimensions are equally necessary for autonomy.</p><p>The interactive dimension of autonomy highlights that autonomous systems must interact with their environment to maintain their organization. For example, in the context of cellular biology, the active transport of ions across the cell membrane is necessary to prevent osmotic crises and maintain the cell's autonomy. However, this interaction can only be carried out because of the underlying constitutive chemical organization that provides the necessary machinery.</p><p>In conclusion, autonomy should not be confused with independence. An autonomous system must interact with its environment to sustain its organization, and this interaction is a crucial aspect of its agential dimension of autonomy. This framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of autonomy in biological systems and acknowledges the importance of their dynamic relationship with the environment.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">10The IAS Research Group – to which the authors of thisbook belong – has been working since the 
last 25 years on autonomous perspective in biology, while extending it to other i elds as cognition, 
society and bioethics. See also the end of this Introduction and footnote 6 in Chap. 1. 
11Hooker has recently def i ned autonomy as “the coordination of the internal metabolic interaction 
cycle and the external environmental interaction cycle so as the latter delivers energy and material 
components to the organism in a usable form and at the times and locations the former requires to 
complete itsregeneration cycles, including regeneration of the autonomy capacity” Hooker (2013). 
Introductionxxix 
Again, there is a reciprocal dependence between what def i nes the conditions 
of existence of the system and the actions derived from its existence: from the 
autonomous perspective, in Jonas’s terms, the system’s doing and its being are two 
sides of the same coin (see also Moreno et al. 2008). In this view, the environment 
becomes a world full of signif i cance: facts that from the outside may appear just 
as purely physical or chemical develop into positive, negative, or neutral inf l uences 
on the system, depending on whether they contribute to, hinder or have no effect 
on the maintenance of its dynamic identity. Even the simplest living organism 
creates a set of preferentialpartitionsof the world, convertinginteractions with their 
surrounding media into elementary values, as we will explain extensively in Chaps. 
4 and 7. Von Uexküll (1982/1940) called this subjective meaningful world of each 
organism Umwelt. The interactive dimension of autonomy is where the nature of 
living systems as inventors of worlds with meaning becomes manifest (see also 
Hoffmeyer 1996). Indeed, this aspect was recognised by Weber and Varela (2002) 
who argued, following Jonas, that autonomy implies a meaningful relation with the 
environment. 
The autonomous perspective that we develop here endeavours then to grasp the 
complexity of biological phenomena, by adequately accounting for their various 
dimensions, specif i cities, and relations with the physical and chemical domains. As 
we will discuss throughout the book, our framework differs in many ways from 
preceding related models, mainly because we aim at – simultaneously – enriching 
and specifying their central tenets, in close contact with current scientif i c theories. 
In the remainder of this introduction, let us give a synthetic overview of the ideas 
that we will be advocating. 
First, the self-determination of the constitutive organisation remains the con- 
ceptual core of autonomy. We share with existing accounts of autonomy the idea 
that biological systems are constituted by a network of causal interactions that 
continuously re-establish their identity (see also Bechtel 2007). The aim of Chap. 1 
will be to provide an explicit conceptual and (preliminarily) formal account of self- 
determination in terms of what we will label “closure of constraints”. 
Biological systems determine (at least in part) themselves, we will contend, 
by constraining themselves: they generate and maintain a set of structures acting 
as constraints which, by harnessing and channelling the processes and reactions 
occurring in the system, contribute to sustain each other, and then the system itself. 
Thecoreofbiologicalorganisationis theclosureofconstraints.We will discuss how 
the concept of closure allows specifying what kind of “circularity” is at work in the 
biological domain, and how it fundamentally differs from other “process loops” 
and self-organising phenomena in Physics and Chemistry. In particular, we will 
emphasise that biological closure requires taking into account, at the same time, 
the conceptual distinction, and yet inherent interdependence, between two causal 
regimes: the constraints themselves and the thermodynamic l ow on which they 
act. In the autonomous perspective, closure (of constraints) and (thermodynamic) 
openness go hand in hand. Self-determination as closure constitutes the pivotal 
idea on which we will build our account of autonomy. A i rst step is made in 
the last section of Chap. 1, where we will claim that biological organisation, to be such, requires regulation. The long-term preservation of biological organisms 
supposes the capacity to self-maintain not only in stable conditions but also, and 
crucially, before potentially deleterious internal or external perturbations. In such 
circumstances, regulatory capacities govern the transition towards a new viable 
situation, be it by countering the perturbations or by establishing a new constitutive 
organisation. In all cases, we will account for regulation in terms of a specif i c set 
of constraints, which contribute to the maintenance of the organisation only when 
its closure is being disrupted: accordingly, we will argue that regulatory constraints 
should be understood as being subject to second-order closure. 
Does the autonomous perspective require appealing to some form of emergen- 
tism? In previous years, some authors have argued that accounts dealing with 
concepts like self-organisation, closure, constraints, autonomy, and related ones 
are indeed committed to the idea that biological organisation is an emergent 
determination. In Chap. 2, we deal with this issue, advocate a monistic stance, 
and provide a twofold argument. First we argue, against exclusion arguments, that 
closure can be consistently (with respect to our monistic assumption) understoodas 
an emergent regime of causation, in the specif i c sense that the relatedness among 
its constituents provides it with distinctive and irreducible properties and causal 
powers. Second, although the closure of the constitutive organisation makes sense 
of the claim that “the very existence of the parts depends on their being involved 
in the whole”, we hold that closure does not imply inter-level causation, in the 
restrictive sense of a causal relation between the whole and its own parts (what we 
label “nested” causation). Yet, we leave room for appealing to nested causation in 
the biological domain, if relevant cases were identif i ed and the adequate conceptual 
justif i cation were provided.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

autonomous perspective presented in this book focuses on grasping the complexity of biological phenomena by considering their various dimensions, specificities, and interactions with the physical and chemical domains. The self-determination of the constitutive organization remains the core concept of autonomy, and it involves the idea that biological systems are constituted by a network of causal interactions that continuously re-establish their identity.</p><p>The concept of "closure of constraints" is used to specify the circularity inherent in the biological domain, distinguishing it from self-organizing phenomena in physics and chemistry. Biological closure requires simultaneously considering the causal regimes of the constraints themselves and the thermodynamic flow on which they act. Regulatory capacities play a crucial role in self-maintenance, and they are governed by specific constraints subject to second-order closure.</p><p>The question of emergentism is addressed, and a monistic stance is advocated, arguing that closure can be understood as an emergent regime of causation. However, the autonomous perspective does not necessarily imply inter-level causation, and nested causation is only invoked if relevant cases are identified and adequately justified in the biological domain.</p><p>Throughout the book, the authors build a comprehensive framework for understanding autonomy in biological systems, emphasizing the interplay between their constitutive and interactive dimensions. By considering the reciprocal dependence between the system's doing and its being, the autonomous perspective highlights the meaningful relation with the environment, as well as the world-creating capacity of living organisms.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">With these clarif i cationsinhand,Chap.3 addressesthequestionof thedistinctive 
emergent features of organisms by arguing, in particular, that the closure of 
constraints provides an adequate and naturalised grounding for the teleology, nor- 
mativity, and functionality of biological organisation. When closure is realised, the 
existenceofthe organisationdepends,as we havealreadyemphasised,on theeffects 
of its own activity: accordingly, biological systems are teleologically organised, in 
a specif i c and scientif i cally legitimate sense. Because of teleology, moreover, the 
activityof theorganismhas an “intrinsicrelevance”which,we submit,generatesthe 
norms that the system is supposed to follow: the system must behave in a specif i c 
way, otherwise it would cease to exist. Hence biological organisation, because of 
closure, is inherently normative. And then, by groundingteleology and normativity, 
closure grounds also functionality in biological organisation: the causal effects 
produced by constraints subject to closure def i ne biological functions. The general 
upshot of the analysis, at the end of Chap. 3, will be the deep theoretical binding 
between “closure”, “organisation”, and “functionality”: it will be our contention 
that, from the autonomous perspective, they are reciprocally def i ning concepts, 
which refer to the very same causal regime. 
The constitutive dimension of closure, however, is not autonomy. As mentioned 
in the preceding pages, autonomy also includes an interactive dimension, dealing 
with the relations between the organism and its environment. We deal with the 
Introductionxxxi 
interactive dimensions in Chap. 4, and refer to it as agency, characterised as a 
set of constraints subject to closure, exerting their causal effects on the boundary 
conditions of the whole system. At the end of the chapter, we argue that a system 
whose organisation realises closure, regulation, and agency, as def i ned in the i rst 
part of the book, is an autonomous system, and therefore a biological organism. 
More precisely, Chap. 4 elaborates on a def i nition of minimal autonomy that 
captures the essential features of biological organisation in its (relatively) most 
simple manifestations, typically in unicellular organisms. 
What has the autonomous perspective to say about more complex organisations 
and specif i cally about multicellular organisms? One of the main weaknesses of the 
organisational tradition in biology is arguably the fact that it has never explicitly 
addressed the issue of higher levels of autonomy: How many levels of autonomy 
can be identif i ed in the biological realm, and what are their mutual relations? In 
Chap. 6, we make a i rst step in this direction: we try to frame the issue of higher- 
levelautonomyin precise termsandsubmit someexplicithypothesesonits features. 
The centralidea will be that what matters for higher-levelautonomyis development. 
More specif i cally, multicellular systems are relevant candidates as organisms when 
their organisation exerts a functional control over the development of unicellular 
components, so to induce their differentiation which, in turn, makes them apt to 
live only in the very specif i c environmentconstituted by the multicellular system: in 
a word, the control over development produces the relevant degree of functional 
integration that distinguishes multicellular organisms (as autonomous systems) 
from other kinds of multicellular systems. What about the relations between levels 
of autonomy? In spite of their differentiation (and then of the loss of some of their 
capacities), we will argue that unicellular constituents of higher-level organisms 
still meet the requirements of autonomy. In fact, the very possibility of higher-level 
autonomy seems to require that lower-level entities preserve an adequate degree 
of complexity: multicellular autonomy requires unicellular autonomy. One of the 
objectives of Chap. 6 (and partly of Chap. 4, last section) will be, by relying on an 
explicit def i nition of autonomy, to provide relevant criteria for examining different 
kinds of higher-level associations and organisations of autonomous systems and 
to compare them on theoretical grounds. In particular, our framework could allow 
locating them in a continuum of organised systems going from, at one extreme, 
those cases fulf i lling only the requirements for closure (as ecosystems) to systems

shifts to addressing the question of higher-level autonomy, specifically in the context of multicellular organisms. The central idea is that what matters for higher-level autonomy is the phenomenon of development. Multicellular systems can be considered organisms when their organization exerts functional control over the development of unicellular components, inducing their differentiation and making them able to thrive only in the specific environment created by the multicellular system. This control over development leads to the functional integration that distinguishes multicellular organisms as autonomous systems.</p><p>The chapter explores the relations between different levels of autonomy and the requirement of preserving an adequate degree of complexity for unicellular constituents within higher-level organisms. Even as the unicellular components differentiate and lose some of their capacities, they still meet the criteria for autonomy. Thus, the possibility of higher-level autonomy seems to rely on the preservation of unicellular autonomy.</p><p>By providing explicit definitions of autonomy, Chap. 6 aims to offer relevant criteria for examining various higher-level associations and organizations of autonomous systems. The framework proposed in this book can help locate these systems on a continuum, from cases fulfilling only the requirements for closure (e.g., ecosystems) to systems gradually becoming more integrated (e.g., cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme), and eventually to genuine multicellular organisms as higher-level autonomous systems. This allows for a theoretical comparison of different kinds of organizations based on their level of autonomy.</p><p>In conclusion, this book's autonomous perspective offers a comprehensive framework for understanding autonomy in biological systems, encompassing both their constitutive and interactive dimensions. By considering the interplay between closure, organization, functionality, and agency, the book provides new insights into the nature of biological organisms, from unicellular to multicellular levels.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: inline-block; overflow: hidden; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; position: relative; max-width: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; display: block; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; max-width: 100%;"><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%2738%27%20height=%2738%27/%3e" style="display: block; max-width: 100%; width: initial; height: initial; background: none; opacity: 1; border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"></span><img alt="User" src="https://chat.openai.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Flh3.googleusercontent.com%2Fa%2FAAcHTtdF1IO9_ztXht2qmdVDc5wzKiB04cnEtzSNv8RWjhw-Tw%3Ds96-c&amp;w=96&amp;q=75" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic" class="rounded-sm" style="position: absolute; inset: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; padding: 0px; border: none; margin: auto; display: block; width: 0px; height: 0px; min-width: 100%; max-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; max-height: 100%;" width="30" height="30"></span></div></div></div><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex items-start overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words flex-col gap-4"><div class="empty:hidden">The transition to multicellularautonomypaves the way towardscognition,which 
is possibly the most amazing innovation during the evolution of life. Cognition, 
as discussed in Chap. 7, is much more than a complex form of agency. It is 
better conceived as a radically new kind of autonomy whose specif i c features and 
dynamics go, qualitatively, far beyond multicellular autonomy, opening the way 
towards our own origins as human beings. In this sense, the analysis of cognition 
is related to the nuclear problem of the gap between the “biological” (broadly 
understood) and the “human” domains. Yet, the autonomous perspective strives 
xxxiiIntroduction 
to understand and explain cognitive capacities in close connection to a bodily 
organisation, which is in turn the product of a long evolutionary process, through 
whichnew phenomenasuch as emotionsor consciousness– and a world of meaning 
and values – have been generated. The appearance of cognition is the result of the 
evolution towards increasingly higher degrees of both constitutive and interactive 
complexity: in this sense, with all its specif i cities, cognition is still a “biogenic” 
(Lyon 2006) phenomenon. By framing the issue of cognition in these terms, we 
think that it can be better handled in naturalised terms, without underestimating 
the formidable diff i culties that any satisfactory account of cognition has to face to 
understandits complex natureand phenomenologicalnovelty.Accordingly,Chap. 7 
is possibly the most ambitious and yet incomplete, since it sketches in a preliminary 
way many problems for which much more work will be required. 
Autonomy, as conceived in this book, lies at the intersection between different 
dimensions, and specif i cally the constitutive and interactive ones, on which we put 
strong emphasis in the previous pages. Yet, this is not the whole story: autonomy 
also has a historical dimension. As we will discuss in Chap. 5, no adequate 
understanding of the emergence of autonomous systems (and specif i cally highly 
complex autonomous systems, as present biological organisms) can be obtained 
without taking into account the evolutionary process that brought them about. 
Autonomous systems are too complex to be spontaneous and cannot self-organise 
(in the sense of generate themselves) as dissipative systems do: their complexity 
requires an evolutionary process of accumulation and preservation. Yet, in addition 
to acknowledging the fundamental place of history in the autonomous perspective, 
we will submit two related ideas. First, the historical dimension does not have the 
same theoretical status as the constitutive and interactive ones: while the latter two 
def i ne autonomy, the former does not. The reason is that we do not need history to 
understand what biological systems are, but rather to understand where they come 
from: these two questions are of course related, but conceptually distinct. Second, 
we will restate the relations between selection and organisation, by advocating the 
general picture according to which the evolution of biological systems stems from 
the mutual interplay between organisation and selection: this is because, as we 
will argue, organisation is a condition, and not only an outcome, of evolutionary 
processes.</div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

not our intention to develop an exhaustive account of biological autonomy, which 
would deal with all aspects and implications of the philosophical and theoretical 
framework. Rather, our ambition is to offer a coherent and integrated picture of 
the autonomous perspective, by focusing on what we think are some of its central 
tenets. Much more could (and hopefully will) be written on biological autonomy, 
but we hope that the ideas of this book can be a useful ground on which future 
investigations will rely...

The authors hope that their ideas will serve as a useful foundation for future investigations and discussions on the topic.</p><p>As of October 7th, 2014, the date of completion of the book, the authors have provided a snapshot of their understanding of biological autonomy, and they anticipate that further developments and insights will arise in subsequent research and discourse.</p><p>Overall, the book contributes to the ongoing exploration of autonomy in biology, and its ideas will likely stimulate further investigations and discussions in this fascinating and evolving field.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="15 18 9 12 15 6"></polyline></svg></button><span class="flex-grow flex-shrink-0">1 / 1</span><button disabled="" class="dark:text-white disabled:text-gray-300 dark:disabled:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-3 w-3" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polyline points="9 18 15 12 9 6"></polyline></svg></button></div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-2 md:gap-3 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"><button class="flex ml-auto gap-2 rounded-md p-1 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg></button><div class="flex gap-1"><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M14 9V5a3 3 0 0 0-3-3l-4 9v11h11.28a2 2 0 0 0 2-1.7l1.38-9a2 2 0 0 0-2-2.3zM7 22H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-7a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h3"></path></svg></button><button class="p-1 rounded-md hover:bg-gray-100 hover:text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:text-gray-200 disabled:dark:hover:text-gray-400"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="h-4 w-4" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M10 15v4a3 3 0 0 0 3 3l4-9V2H5.72a2 2 0 0 0-2 1.7l-1.38 9a2 2 0 0 0 2 2.3zm7-13h2.67A2.31 2.31 0 0 1 22 4v7a2.31 2.31 0 0 1-2.33 2H17"></path></svg></button></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group w-full text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="flex p-4 gap-4 text-base md:gap-6 md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-[38rem] xl:max-w-3xl md:py-6 lg:px-0 m-auto"><div class="flex-shrink-0 flex flex-col relative items-end"><div class="w-[30px]"><div class="relative flex"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;

the first chapter of "Context Changes Everything" by Alicia Juarrero and the article "Our brains exist in a state of 'controlled hallucination' by Matthew Hutson" can shed light on how our understanding of cognition and perception is intertwined with the concept of context and its influence on our experiences and actions. Here are some possible connections between the two:</p><ol><li><p>Perception and Context: In the article by Matthew Hutson, he discusses how our brains interpret sensory inputs and create our perception of reality. He emphasizes that our perception is not a direct representation of the external world but rather a result of the brain's processing of sensory information within a particular context. This idea resonates with Juarrero's perspective on the importance of context in shaping cognition. In her book, she likely explores how context plays a crucial role in determining the meaning and significance of our actions and experiences.</p></li><li><p>Contextual Causation: Juarrero's work delves into the concept of causal relations within a contextual framework. She emphasizes that causation should be understood in a broader context, where different factors and interactions contribute to the emergence of specific outcomes. The idea of "controlled hallucination" in Hutson's article aligns with this perspective, as our brain's interpretation of sensory data is influenced by a complex interplay of internal cognitive processes and external context.</p></li><li><p>Autonomous Systems and Perception: The notion of autonomous systems, as discussed in Juarrero's book, is closely related to the idea of controlled hallucination in the brain. Autonomous systems are self-regulating and exhibit emergent behaviors based on their internal dynamics and interactions with the environment. Similarly, our brain's controlled hallucination involves processing sensory information to make sense of the world, allowing us to perceive and act in our environment autonomously.</p></li><li><p>Emergence and Complexity: Both the book and the article touch on the concepts of emergence and complexity. Juarrero likely explores how complex systems, including the brain, give rise to emergent properties and behaviors that are not reducible to their individual components. Similarly, the controlled hallucination in the brain arises from the intricate interactions between neurons, neural networks, and higher-order cognitive processes, resulting in our perceptual experiences.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the connections between the concepts discussed in the first chapter of "Context Changes Everything" and the ideas presented in the article "Our brains exist in a state of 'controlled hallucination'" highlight the significance of context and complexity in shaping our perception, cognition, and understanding of the world. Both works contribute to the broader understanding of how our minds work within the intricate web of causal relations and contextual influences.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between

overview of the connections between the first chapter of "Context Changes Everything" by Alicia Juarrero and the article "Our brains exist in a state of 'controlled hallucination'" by Matthew Hutson:</p><ol><li><p>Perception and Context: Both works emphasize that our perception of the world is not a direct reflection of reality but is heavily influenced by the context in which we experience it. Juarrero explores how context shapes our understanding and actions, while Hutson explains how our brain's interpretation of sensory inputs is influenced by the broader context.</p></li><li><p>Contextual Causation: Juarrero discusses causal relations within a contextual framework, suggesting that outcomes are a result of various interacting factors. This idea aligns with Hutson's notion of "controlled hallucination," where the brain's interpretation of sensory data is influenced by internal processes and external factors.</p></li><li><p>Autonomous Systems and Perception: Juarrero's book explores autonomous systems that self-regulate and exhibit emergent behaviors. Similarly, the brain's controlled hallucination involves autonomous processing of sensory information to perceive and act in the environment.</p></li><li><p>Emergence and Complexity: Both works touch on the concepts of emergence and complexity. Juarrero discusses how complex systems give rise to emergent properties and behaviors, while Hutson's article implies that the brain's controlled hallucination arises from intricate neural interactions.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, the connections highlight the importance of context and complexity in shaping our perception and cognition. The brain's controlled hallucination and the emergence of autonomous systems illustrate how our minds interpret and interact with the world in sophisticated ways.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex

Here's a list of everything we've discussed so far:</p><ol><li><p>"Context Changes Everything" - A book by Alicia Juarrero, focusing on contextual causation, autonomous systems, and emergence.</p></li><li><p>"Our brains exist in a state of 'controlled hallucination'" - An article by Matthew Hutson, discussing how our perception is influenced by internal processes and external context.</p></li><li><p>Kantian Perspective - The idea of purposiveness and teleology in living beings, focusing on self-organization and holistic organization.</p></li><li><p>Organicism - The view that living organisms have a specific organization resulting from the reciprocal interplay among all its components.</p></li><li><p>Prigogine's Dissipative Structures - The concept of self-organization in far-from-equilibrium conditions in physics.</p></li><li><p>Autopoiesis - The theory proposed by Maturana and Varela, describing the capacity of self-production and self-maintenance in biological metabolism.</p></li><li><p>Autonomy - The concept of self-determination and self-maintenance in biological systems.</p></li><li><p>Closure of Constraints - The idea that biological systems generate and maintain a set of structures that contribute to sustaining their identity.</p></li><li><p>Regulation - The capacity of biological systems to self-maintain, especially in the face of perturbations.</p></li><li><p>Agency - The interactive dimension of autonomy, involving the causal effects of constraints on the boundary conditions of the whole system.</p></li><li><p>Multicellular Autonomy - The transition to higher levels of autonomy in multicellular organisms, related to the control over the development of unicellular components.</p></li><li><p>Cognition - A new kind of autonomy that goes beyond multicellular autonomy, involving complex cognitive capacities.</p></li><li><p>Evolution - The historical dimension of autonomy, considering the evolutionary process that led to the emergence of autonomous systems.</p></li><li><p>Perception and Context - How our perception of the world is influenced by the context in which we experience it.</p></li><li><p>Contextual Causation - The idea that outcomes are a result of various interacting factors within a contextual framework.</p></li><li><p>Emergence and Complexity - The concepts of emergent properties and behaviors arising from complex systems.</p></li></ol><p>These topics cover a wide range of ideas in philosophy, biology, neuroscience, and the nature of perception and cognition.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between lg:block"><div class="text-xs flex items-center justify-center gap-1 self-center pt-2 !invisible"><button disabled=""

explored several interconnected topics from various fields, including philosophy, biology, neuroscience, and cognitive science. The central theme was the concept of autonomy in living systems and its implications for understanding the complexity of life. Here's a final summary of the key points:</p><ol><li><p>Autonomy: Autonomy refers to the self-determination and self-maintenance capacity of living systems. Biological autonomy goes beyond mere self-organization, as it involves the active preservation of a system's identity and function through interactions with its environment.</p></li><li><p>Organicism and Kantian Perspective: The organicist view emphasizes the reciprocal interplay among the components of living organisms, giving rise to specific organizational features. The Kantian perspective emphasizes purposiveness and teleology in living beings, highlighting self-organization and holistic organization.</p></li><li><p>Prigogine's Dissipative Structures: In physics, Prigogine's theory explores self-organization in far-from-equilibrium conditions, which helped inspire new perspectives on complexity in biology.</p></li><li><p>Autopoiesis: Proposed by Maturana and Varela, autopoiesis describes the capacity of self-production and self-maintenance in biological metabolism, contributing to the understanding of autonomy in living systems.</p></li><li><p>Closure of Constraints: Biological systems maintain their identity by generating and sustaining a set of structures that act as constraints, providing a coherent framework for the system's organization.</p></li><li><p>Regulation and Agency: Regulation involves the system's ability to maintain itself, especially in the face of perturbations. Agency, on the other hand, encompasses the interactive dimension of autonomy, with constraints exerting causal effects on the system's boundary conditions.</p></li><li><p>Multicellular Autonomy: As living systems evolve into multicellular organisms, higher-level autonomy emerges, involving control over the development of unicellular components and integration of functions.</p></li><li><p>Cognition: Cognition represents a novel form of autonomy, far beyond multicellular autonomy, involving complex cognitive capacities and the emergence of meaning and values.</p></li><li><p>Evolution: The historical dimension of autonomy recognizes the role of evolutionary processes in shaping and preserving the complexity of living systems.</p></li><li><p>Perception and Context: Our perception of the world is influenced by internal processes and the context in which we experience it, leading to the concept of contextual causation.</p></li><li><p>Emergence and Complexity: Emergent properties and behaviors arise from complex systems, contributing to the understanding of autonomy and organization in living systems.</p></li></ol><p>Overall, our discussions highlighted the importance of context, self-determination, and interdependence in understanding biological autonomy and the fascinating complexity of life.
