# Geometric Extraction and Entropy-Constrained Structural Stability

This work represents a synthesis of political economy, differential geometry, thermodynamics, and category theory. By modeling digital platforms as geometric distortions within an informational manifold, it converts what is often a rhetorical critique of “extraction” into a mathematically analyzable instability phenomenon. Structural asymmetry is translated into curvature, reinforcement into dynamical flow, and monopolistic lock-in into singularity formation within a precisely defined manifold.

## I. The Geometry of Extraction as Phase Instability

The framework models digital interaction space as a Riemannian manifold \( M \), whose metric encodes informational distance between semantic states. Platforms are not treated as firms with market share but as scalar potentials embedded within this manifold.

When reinforcement is amplified without proportional dissipation, sectional curvature becomes strictly positive across expanding regions. By the Jacobi equation, positive curvature induces geodesic convergence: initially distinct agent trajectories contract toward shared attractor basins. Lock-in is thus formalized as curvature-induced trajectory collapse rather than mere consumer inertia.

The **Curvature Singularity Theorem** sharpens this insight. If reinforcement strength \( \alpha \) exceeds dissipation \( \lambda \), curvature evolves under a superlinear regime, producing finite-time blow-up. Geometrically, the manifold develops a singularity; economically, interaction diversity collapses into monopolistic concentration. The instability emerges from dynamical imbalance, not malicious intent.

Extraction is therefore recast as a geometric phase transition.

## II. Entropy Soundness as Thermodynamic Constraint

The proposed solution operates at the substrate level rather than at the behavioral layer. The **Entropy Soundness Theorem** establishes an upper bound on entropy growth along any compositional trace. For a sequence of rule applications \( \tau \), the entropy of the resulting semantic sphere satisfies:

```
E(σ_n) ≤ E(σ_0) + Φ(τ)
```

where \( Φ(τ) \) is the sum of declared entropy budgets.

Semantic evolution becomes a constrained thermodynamic process.

Two pathological regimes are excluded.

First, semantic heat death—characterized by uncontrolled entropy inflation—is ruled out because no transformation may exceed its declared entropy allowance. Second, curvature amplification is indirectly constrained because entropy growth and scalar density are coupled in the governing field equations. Bounded entropy implies bounded scalar accumulation, preventing well-depth divergence.

The **Crystal Economy** extends these constraints through conservation principles.

Texture Crystals measure informational novelty by subtracting mutual information between modalities, introducing a redundancy penalty into valuation. Optimization aligns private incentive with reduction of informational overlap, discouraging duplication-based amplification.

Time Crystals introduce exponential decay via a global constant \( γ \). Influence persists only through active extension. Without decay, stigmergic accumulation saturates into singularity; with decay, curvature dissipates. This mirrors pheromone evaporation in swarm systems.

## III. Structural Antitrust as Categorical Invariant

The categorical formalization defines a category **C** whose objects are semantic spheres and whose morphisms are entropy-safe rule applications. Composition respects entropy budgets and conservation laws.

Extraction is defined abstractly as an endofunctor that increases curvature or violates entropy bounds. However, every morphism in **C** must satisfy entropy safety and invariant preservation. Any transformation that induces extraction cannot be represented as a lawful endofunctor within the category.

Structural antitrust is therefore encoded at the type level. Extractive morphisms are ill-typed. The substrate algebra excludes pathological transformations by construction.

## IV. Unified Structural Stability

The **Unified Structural Stability Theorem** integrates geometric, thermodynamic, and probabilistic arguments.

First, bounded entropy and curvature imply tightness of the induced Markov semigroup over semantic states. By Krylov–Bogolyubov theory, at least one invariant probability measure exists. Long-run stability follows in the sense of measure-preserving dynamics.

Second, curvature blow-up is excluded because entropy budgets limit scalar amplification. Ricci bounds prevent geodesic focusing from reaching singular levels.

Third, heat death is excluded because entropy growth is bounded linearly rather than exponentially. Lyapunov analysis shows that entropy-bounded dynamics admit non-increasing free energy functionals, whereas engagement-maximizing systems generate exponential entropy escalation.

The system thus admits invariant measures, excludes singularities, and resists degenerative noise inflation.

## V. Autocatalysis and Civilizational Scale

The framework generalizes to complex adaptive systems.

Stigmergic coordination requires decay. Without dissipation, trace accumulation produces congestion singularities. The **Decay Necessity Theorem** extends this across biological and digital domains.

Chipification and renormalization demonstrate that organizational structures persist across substrate migration. Universality results show that computable production processes are emulable across scales. Stability is therefore not hardware-dependent but invariant-dependent.

The broader claim is architectural: stability is manufactured by embedding conservation laws into execution layers. Extraction is a dynamical imbalance, not a moral failure. The correction lies in structural design rather than behavioral regulation.
