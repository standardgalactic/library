# Executive Summary: Manufacturing Stability

This paper argues that contemporary digital systems are not merely economically unequal but structurally unstable. It develops a formal geometric and thermodynamic framework for diagnosing this instability and proposes an alternative computational substrate designed to prevent it at the architectural level.

## Part I: Extraction as Geometric Instability

The political economy of dominant platforms is reformulated in differential-geometric and information-theoretic terms.

Information space is modeled as a Riemannian manifold. Platform dominance corresponds to curvature concentration within this manifold. High-curvature regions function as scalar wells that contract geodesic diversity, producing herding, lock-in, and coordination collapse. Extraction is therefore interpreted as geometric phase instability rather than merely inequitable allocation.

Predictive asymmetry is formalized as divergence between user self-models and platform-constructed models. This divergence, expressible via Kullback–Leibler distance, grows under unconstrained engagement optimization. The resulting epistemic imbalance constitutes informational expropriation.

A central incompatibility theorem establishes that engagement-maximizing dynamics are thermodynamically unstable. In the absence of bounded entropy production, the system converges either to semantic heat death—unbounded entropy inflation—or to curvature singularity—monopolistic attractor concentration. No dynamically stable regime exists under unrestricted engagement maximization.

## Part II: Entropy-Bounded Substrate Design

The proposed alternative is not a competing platform but a modified substrate for digital interaction in which extraction is algebraically inadmissible.

Knowledge is encoded as typed semantic spheres endowed with intrinsic identity, modality structure, measurable entropy, and explicit provenance graphs. Transformations of these objects are governed by entropy budgets. The Entropy Soundness Theorem proves that entropy growth along any execution trace is bounded by declared rule budgets, preventing silent semantic degradation.

A conservation-based valuation replaces attention metrics. Texture Crystals reward non-redundant informational contribution by penalizing mutual information overlap across modalities. Time Crystals reward provenance but impose exponential decay, preventing permanent accumulation of influence. Lock-in becomes dynamically unstable.

Global semantic coherence is enforced via sheaf-theoretic closure. Locally consistent assignments must glue uniquely into global objects, preventing contradictory states from coexisting within the same semantic universe.

Categorically, extractive transformations correspond to endofunctors that would increase curvature or violate entropy bounds. Such functors are inadmissible because they break invariant-preserving structure. Structural antitrust is embedded directly into the algebra of the substrate.

## Part III: Stability Across Scales

The framework generalizes beyond platform economics to a broader theory of stability in complex adaptive systems.

Cognition is modeled as hierarchical control under entropy constraints. Higher-level invariants constrain lower-level scenario evaluation. Unstable informational substrates inflate cognitive entropy, increasing metabolic and inferential burden.

Stigmergic systems require decay. A Decay Necessity Theorem shows that without bounded reinforcement and trace dissipation, cumulative modification produces geometric singularities. Stability requires disciplined forgetting.

The historical process of chipification is interpreted as renormalization of organizational structure across scales. Any finite computable production process admits universal emulation. Organizational invariants persist under substrate migration, even as physical scale contracts.

Control theory and geometry converge in this account. A system’s objective function induces a potential field on the interaction manifold. Engagement maximization steepens curvature. Entropy-bounded design flattens it. Stability emerges from controlled dissipation rather than accumulation.

## Conclusion: Stability as Architectural Property

Stability is not given; it is engineered.

The fundamental distinction is not between regulation and deregulation, but between architectural regimes. Engagement-optimized architectures produce curvature concentration and instability. Entropy-bounded architectures embed conservation constraints that preclude singularity formation.

The proposal therefore shifts from policy-level correction to substrate-level design: stability must be manufactured through invariant-preserving infrastructure.
