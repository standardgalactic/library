<p>Title: Unified Framework for Quantum Mechanics: Recursive Causality,
TARTAN, and Unistochastic Quantum Theory (UQT)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Recursive Causality in RSVP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recursive causality is a dynamic extension of Vopson’s static
entropic gravity model within the Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum
(RSVP) framework.</li>
<li>Key elements include scalar field entropy (<span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>) and negentropic vector flows (<span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{v}\)</span>).</li>
<li>Their evolution is governed by coupled differential equations:
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial t} = -
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} + \text{(source/sink terms)}\)</span>
(describing how negentropic fluxes drive entropy changes)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} =
-\nabla \Phi + \text{(terms governing flow dynamics)}\)</span> (showing
how vector flows respond to entropy gradients).</li>
</ol></li>
<li>These equations describe a self-referential loop, where scalar field
(<span class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>) gradients produce
negentropic fluxes, which in turn alter <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi\)</span>. Additional terms represent physical
characteristics like torsion and inertia.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Introduction of TARTAN within RSVP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>TARTAN (Trajectories, Annotated Noise, Recursive tiling, and
Scalar-vector plenum ANalysis) is a multiscale lattice framework
integrated into RSVP.</li>
<li>Key features:
<ol type="1">
<li>Trajectory Buffers: Each tile encodes short-term evolutionary paths
for computing forward transition probabilities.</li>
<li>Annotated Perturbations: Perturbations carry semantic tags (e.g.,
“proto-collapse,” “torsion burst”) for structured stochastic modeling of
transitions between local field states.</li>
<li>Scale-Aware Transition Matrices: Coarse-grained projections yield
unistochastic matrices, derived from phase-coherent recursive
dynamics.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>TARTAN enhances RSVP simulations by capturing recursive
entropy-vector interactions, supporting causal visualization, and
enabling adaptive simulation fidelity based on entropy and torsion
gradients.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration with Unistochastic Quantum Theory
(UQT)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>RSVP’s recursive field dynamics provide a physical foundation for
UQT’s probabilistic transitions through unistochastic matrices.</li>
<li>TARTAN acts as a bridge, encoding trajectory memory and structured
perturbations within RSVP:
<ol type="1">
<li>It allows local field regions (tiles) to evolve with probabilistic
behavior derived from entropy-vector interaction patterns.</li>
<li>Transition matrices (<span class="math inline">\(P_{ij} =
|U_{ij}|^2\)</span>) reflect causal likelihoods of one semantic region
evolving into another, establishing quantum measurement probabilities as
emergent from recursive, deterministic entropy dynamics.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>This integration recovers the Born rule through entropy-weighted
transition integrals over causal tilings in TARTAN.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<p>This unified framework proposes an epistemic interpretation of
quantum mechanics grounded in physical field dynamics and causal
structure, rather than metaphysical wavefunction collapse or many-worlds
interpretations. It offers a computationally emergent signature of
recursive entropic evolution within RSVP’s scalar-vector plenum,
potentially bridging static/expanding universe models with probabilistic
quantum theory through TARTAN.</p>
<p><strong>Future Directions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Code-level implementations of TARTAN within RSVP for detailed
simulations and visualizations.</li>
<li>Formal LaTeX formulations of derived equations to enhance clarity
and precision in theoretical presentations.</li>
<li>Experimental validations against observed quantum phenomena to test
the framework’s predictive power and explanatory capacity.</li>
</ul>
