That's a fascinating concept! Using text editors as symbols for these roles adds a layer of modern relevance that can resonate with audiences familiar with coding or tech culture. It sounds like your play not only explores the dynamics of blame and praise but also touches on the tribalism within tech communities. What inspired you to use vim and emacs specifically for these roles?

User
Because I was first introduced to vim the first time I used emacs it said would you like to choose vim or emacs, and I chose vim. It was less then a few hours when I found commands from vim that were not emulated in emacs, and found it clunky and bloated although you could play tetris, even basic connects were chords or sequences but were just one letter in vim. Soon I found I could i could do anything I could with emacs in just vim which is quicker to enter and exit. Plus I outsourced window and pane management to byobu and windows, using vim for just text editing. In my system vim stands for efficiency and eases of use, whereas emacs stands for overcomplicated solutions.

Scene Setup: Commander Keen is faced with a complex server setup that requires navigating through multiple nested bash sessions to troubleshoot and configure the system.

Commander Keen: (typing into the terminal) Okay, let's think of this like a level in a game. Each session is a room with its own puzzles.

Tech Specialist #1: (watching over his shoulder) But every mistake could lock us out or crash the system. It's risky.

Commander Keen: (focused) In Keen, every jump counts. Here, every command does. (types a command) So, we dive deeper with each 'sudo' and 'ssh', like going through doors to the next level.

Tech Specialist #2: (nervously) And if you get lost?

Commander Keen: (typing another command) That's where mapping comes in. (shows a sketch of nested sessions on paper) See this? It's like my map for the level. Each session, a step closer to the exit'solving the problem.

Tech Specialist #3: (impressed) Never thought of it like that. You're turning system admin into an adventure game.

Commander Keen: (smiling as he executes another command) Exactly! And like any good game, knowing the shortcuts and secret commands can make all the difference. (pauses, then hits enter) And there's our exit. System's up and running.

This scene not only showcases Commander Keen's problem-solving skills and his unique approach to challenges but also ties back to his gaming background, making his methods relatable and innovative to his peers in the story.
