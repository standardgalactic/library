ChatGPT dijo:
Here���s a consolidated list of all the main projects you're currently working on, based on our ongoing conversations. Each is grouped by theme and includes brief descriptions to help track their scope and integration points:
����
Core RSVP Field Theory Projects
Relativistic Scalar Vector Plenum (RSVP) Theory
Core field theory modeling the universe as a thermodynamic plenum with scalar entropy fields (��), baryon vector flows (����), and entropy density (S).
Includes variational principles, conservation laws, and field PDEs.
BV-AKSZ Quantization of RSVP
Full derived geometric BV-BRST quantization of RSVP using (-1)-shifted symplectic structures.
Constructs a sigma model with ghost/antifield structure from PTVV and AKSZ formalism.
RSVP Cosmology & Entropic Smoothing
Alternative cosmological model replacing expansion with entropic smoothing of matter and radiation.
Includes predictions for horizon entropy, CMB patterns, and perturbation growth.
RSVP-TARTAN Framework
Thermodynamic Atlas for Recursive Tiling and Network dynamics.
Encodes scalar-vector entropy flows as CRDT-based tiling automata with L-system rules and entropy metrics.
����
Cognition, Mind, and Information Geometry
Field-Theoretic Consciousness Model (RSVP-based)
Models conscious awareness as spatiotemporal dynamics of entropy and semantic flow fields.
Integrates ��_RSVP as a consciousness metric from spectral dynamics and information geometry.
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)
A neurocognitive and AI model describing affordance navigation via index-based semantic activation rather than representations.
Reframes perception and action in terms of field access paths.
Semantic Phase Space & Ethical Dynamics
Develops a geometry of meaning and value using RSVP fields and derived stacks.
Integrates ethical gradient flows and path-dependent constraints on semantic field evolution.
Mind Uploading & Identity Preservation (RSVP-TARTAN-HDT)
Formal model of distributed cognition as field semantics, not substrate replication.
Uses RSVP fields to model semantic continuity across physical transitions.
����
Mathematical and Formal Structures
Derived L-System Sigma Models
Models tiling and rewriting rules via derived geometry and AKSZ-like sigma models.
Encodes ethical constraints into production rules as thermodynamic laws.
Obstruction Theory for RSVP Singularities
Uses derived stacks and cotangent complexes to model and resolve singular field behavior.
Supports dynamical transitions, bifurcations, and cognitive thresholds.
Semantic Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem
Extends the index theorem to sheaf-theoretic cognition and derived moduli of entropy flows.
Bridges geometry, analysis, and cognition through RSVP formalism.
Entropy Fiber Products and Derived Tiling Algebras
Encodes recursive tiling algebras and CRDTs via derived fiber products.
Models entropy conservation, causality, and deformation in multi-agent thermodynamic systems.
����
Simulation and Application
RSVP Field Simulator
A PDE-based simulator implementing the RSVP field equations.
Includes tools for tracking entropy vortices, singularities, and information flows in spacetime.
Phase Vortex Tracking Toolbox (PVTT)
Toolset for identifying topological features (e.g. ��������� ��� 0) in RSVP field simulations.
Tied to consciousness, attention, and memory trace modeling.
AGI Risk, Safety, and SNEEDU Ethics
Embeds RSVP entropy dynamics in AI safety frameworks (e.g., thermodynamic ethics).
SNEEDU = Semantic, Non-Entropic, Ethical, Distributed, Uncorruptible systems.
����
Meta and Commentary Projects
Gravity as Entropy Descent: Commentary on Emergent Gravity
Formal critique and alternative to Jacobson, Verlinde, and Carney's models using RSVP.
Highlights field-theoretic and thermodynamic derivations of gravity.
RSVP Theory Monograph
A comprehensive book on RSVP field theory, cognition, cosmology, and derived quantization.
Includes theory, simulation, applications, and philosophical implications.
Comparative Paper on Entropic Gravity Models vs RSVP
Academic paper contrasting RSVP with emergent gravity theories.
Includes core equations, assumptions, and predictions.
