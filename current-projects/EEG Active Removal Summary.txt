Abstract
The removal of no-longer-relevant information from visual working memory (WM) is important for the functioning of WM, given its severe capacity limitation. Previously, with an ���ABC-retrocuing��� WM task, we have shown that removing information can be accomplished in different ways: by simply withdrawing attention from the newly irrelevant memory item (IMI; i.e., via ���passive removal���); or by or ���actively��� removing the IMI from WM (Shan and Postle, 2022). Here, to investigate the neural mechanisms behind active removal, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from human subjects (both sexes) performing the ABC-retrocuing task. Specifically, we tested the hijacked adaptation model, which posits that active removal is accomplished by a top-down-triggered down-modulation of the gain of perceptual circuits, such that sensory channels tuned to the to-be-removed information become less sensitive. Behaviorally, analyses revealed that, relative to passive removal, active removal produced a decline in the familiarity landscape centered on the IMI. Neurally, we focused on two epochs of the task, corresponding to the triggering, and to the consequence, of active removal. With regard to triggering, we observed a stronger anterior-to-posterior traveling wave for active versus passive removal. With regard to the consequence(s) of removal, the response to a task-irrelevant ���ping��� was reduced for active removal, as assessed with ERP, suggesting that active removal led to decreased excitability in perceptual circuits centered on the IMI.

Significance Statement The removal of no-longer-relevant information from working memory is critical for the flexible control of behavior. However, to our knowledge, the only explicit accounts of this operation describe the simple withdrawal of attention from that information (i.e., ���passive removal���). Here, with measurements of behavior and electroencephalography (EEG), we provide evidence for a specific mechanism for the active removal of information from WM���hijacked adaptation���via the top-down triggering of an adaptation-like down-regulation of gain of the perceptual circuits tuned to the to-be-removed information. These results may have implications for disorders of mental health, including rumination, intrusion of negative thoughts, and hallucination.

����
Core Idea
Working memory (WM) can remove no-longer-relevant information either
passively
(by shifting attention away) or
actively
(by functionally erasing it). This study identifies EEG correlates of
active removal
, providing neural evidence that this process involves
top-down modulation
of sensory circuits���what they call the
"hijacked adaptation" model
.
����
Methodology
Task:
Participants performed the
ABC-retrocuing
task, where an irrelevant memory item (IMI) is cued for removal.
EEG Measurement:
Tracked both the
trigger
and
consequence
of active removal.
Comparison:
Active vs. Passive removal conditions.
���
Key Findings
Behavioral Result
:
Active removal led to a measurable
decline in the familiarity landscape
around the IMI���indicating a more complete erasure than passive removal.
EEG Findings
:
Triggering Phase
:
Active removal generated
stronger anterior-to-posterior traveling waves
, suggesting a top-down signal initiating removal.
Consequence Phase
:
A
reduced ERP response to a task-irrelevant ���ping���
indicated
lower excitability
in perceptual circuits tuned to the IMI, consistent with decreased sensory gain.
����
Interpretation: Hijacked Adaptation Model
Active removal is not merely shifting attention but
modifying the gain of sensory neurons
that encode the now-irrelevant item���mimicking adaptation.
This suggests a
neural overwrite mechanism
, possibly to prevent interference or intrusive thoughts.
��������
Significance
This is among the first direct neural evidence for
active removal
as a distinct cognitive operation, not just absence of attention.
Potential implications for:
Mental health
: Understanding/remediating intrusive thoughts (e.g., in PTSD, OCD, depression).
Cognitive control
: Enhancing flexibility in WM-based tasks or AI models of attention.

Scientists find a built-in 'memory janitor' that helps your brain forget some things on purpose
Eric Ralls
ByEric Ralls
Earth.com staff writer
When you juggle a phone number, an address, and directions ��� all while driving ��� you will notice that stray memory details, like the jingle on the radio, try to muscle their way in and vie for space and attention in your brain.



Neuroscientists have long suspected that the brain employs an internal ���memory janitor��� that���s able to sweep that clutter away, and a new study finally catches the cleanup crew in action.

EarthSnap
The evidence comes from cognitive neuroscientists Jiangang Shan and Bradley Postle at the University of Wisconsin���Madison, who traced how volunteers intentionally dropped one memory item to make room for another and then mapped the electrical ripple that followed the internal command.

Why the brain clears memory space
Working memory is famously stingy, holding only about four independent chunks before performance crashes. Because that ceiling never grows across adulthood, clearing stale or distracting content is the only way to keep goals on course.

The idea that we can store seven plus or minus two items dates to George Miller���s 1956 essay, but later work shows that number shrinks once chunking tricks and rehearsal are stripped away.

Active deletion therefore matters even more than passive forgetting when the cognitive stakes are high.

Failing to clear the cache can feed rumination and other intrusive thought loops tied to depression, anxiety, and hallucinations.

Pinning down the neural broom that prunes irrelevant data may expose a direct therapeutic target for disorders that hijack the mind���s limited spotlight.

A 2019 meta���analysis found that intrusive memories dog 76���percent of adults with major depressive disorder, underscoring how common and stubborn unwanted recollections can be. An efficient erase signal could help break that cycle.

Brain waves that erase memory
Using scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, Shan and Postle spotted an anterior���to���posterior traveling wave that surged down the cortex roughly 160���milliseconds after a ���forget��� cue.

The rapid sweep looked like a top���down shout from executive regions toward the visual areas that first encoded the now���irrelevant detail.

That directional burst was markedly stronger than the weak hum seen when participants simply ignored an item, hinting that active deletion is a distinct operation rather than a slow fade powered by neglect.

A separate analysis showed that stronger waves predicted cleaner recall of the surviving item, tying the electrical surge to practical memory benefits.



Early animal studies link traveling waves to attention shifts, but the new human data confirm that the same mechanism can serve a more radical purpose, silencing content outright.

By converting an attention tool into a forgetting tool, the cortex re���uses existing circuitry instead of inventing a bespoke system.

How the test showed memory deletion
Twenty���nine adults stared at two colored bars on a screen, memorizing their orientations, and then received a cue naming which bar to discard before a third bar appeared.

The tricky part: all bars shared the same format, so participants had to surgically erase only the flagged target while preserving everything else.



Because EEG captures brain rhythms at millisecond resolution, the team watched the decision and its aftermath unfold in real time.

They also fired a brief ���ping,��� a flash matching the banished color, during the delay to probe any lingering excitability in the relevant neural channels.

A control condition left forgetting to happen passively, giving the researchers a baseline trace for comparison. That contrast let them separate mere inattention from the active���removal process.

How the brain silences old info
���Active removal led to decreased excitability in perceptual circuits centered on the unwanted information,��� report Shan and Postle.



After active removal, the visual cortex barely flinched at the ping, evidence that its circuits had been deliberately dampened. 

That engineered silence contrasts with passive forgetting, where the same probe evokes a modest after���shock that slowly decays, suggesting the trace lingers and can still meddle with new material.

The neural hush also predicts smaller interference effects on later trials, confirming that the brain���s tidy���up translates into cleaner behavior.

Active brain memory deletion beats fading
Passive forgetting starves a detail of attention until it slips below awareness, much like muting a television you no longer watch.



Active forgetting uses the adaptation���hijacking mechanism, throttling neuronal gain so the discarded feature cannot compete later.

Behaviorally, items erased in this way leave a measurable repulsive after���effect on subsequent perception, a fingerprint that never appears after passive withdrawal and one that further underscores the existence of two cleanup tools inside the same brain.

Why it matters for mental health
People who ruminate struggle to swap out emotional memory information and commit more false alarms in brain memory tasks, underscoring how sticky thoughts hamper cognitive control.



Training the brain���s active���removal memory circuit could give these individuals a concrete method to quench spirals of negativity.

Hallucinations in psychosis, intrusive memories in post���traumatic stress disorder, and even compulsive cravings might also flare when unwanted content refuses eviction.

Boosting the frontal wave, or mimicking its effect with targeted stimulation, could tip the balance back toward flexible, goal���directed thinking.



Clinical teams already experiment with cognitive���control exercises and non���invasive brain stimulation; the new findings supply a physiological marker to gauge whether those interventions truly engage the forgetting pathway.

How this works in daily life
The ABC���retrocuing task uses abstract shapes, yet the principle probably scales to everyday situations, such as clearing a coworker���s outdated instructions before a meeting pivots to a new agenda.

Ordinary forgetfulness may hinge less on storage capacity and more on how quickly the cleanup signal fires when priorities flip.

Understanding that signal could even inform workplace design: regular micro���breaks might allow the brain to issue its erase order before the next demand floods in, shaving off mistakes rooted in lingering clutter.



What���s next in brain and memory research
Shan and Postle now plan to pair transcranial magnetic stimulation with EEG to test whether amplifying the anterior���to���posterior wave speeds forgetting and improves downstream recall accuracy.

Meanwhile, computational neuroscientists are adding adaptive gain control to artificial networks, hoping to build machines that forget with the same finesse as humans.

���It is surprisingly hard to teach an algorithm to know what not to remember,��� Postle notes in a university briefing.




If that memory challenge is cracked, voice assistants and self-driving cars could avoid brain overload by erasing sensor snapshots the instant they become obsolete.

The study is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

summary and synthesis
of the
Earth.com
article by Eric Ralls, written in an accessible narrative style but grounded in the technical findings of Shan and Postle:
��������
Your Brain Has a Built-In ���Memory Janitor��� That Actively Forgets
Core Finding
Scientists at the University of Wisconsin���Madison, Jiangang Shan and Bradley Postle, have
captured direct neural evidence
that the brain
actively deletes
irrelevant information from working memory���not just by ignoring it, but by triggering a
deliberate erasure signal
.
This process uses a
top-down electrical sweep
���an
anterior-to-posterior traveling wave
���that dampens the perceptual circuits encoding the now-unwanted memory.
����
Why It Matters
Working memory is limited
(~4 chunks), so deleting stale data is critical for flexible thought.
Failure to clear memory clutter
contributes to
rumination, intrusive thoughts, hallucinations, and compulsions
.
Identifying a
physiological forgetting mechanism
opens the door to
therapies
for mental health disorders that involve ���sticky��� memories.
����
The Study: ABC-Retrocuing Task
Participants memorized two colored bars, then got a cue to
forget one
before a third bar appeared.
EEG captured the real-time brain response to this ���forget��� instruction.
A brief
���ping��� flash
probed whether the brain had truly dampened the representation of the forgotten item.
���
Main Results
Active Deletion = Top-Down Wave
A rapid wave traveled from the
frontal cortex to sensory areas
~160 ms after the forget cue.
This wave was
much stronger
than what occurred in passive forgetting (just ignoring the item).
Engineered Neural Silence
The ���ping��� produced
no response
in sensory areas if active deletion had occurred���indicating
successful suppression
.
In contrast, passive forgetting left behind a
residual neural trace
, making interference more likely.
Behavioral Benefit
Stronger waves =
cleaner memory
for remaining items and
fewer mistakes
in recall.
����
Neuroscience Implications
The brain
reuses attentional wave mechanisms
to achieve deletion.
This
adaptive hijacking
is more efficient than building a separate ���erase��� module.
Animal studies
linked such waves to attention; this study shows they also
prune memory
.
����
Mental Health Applications
People with
depression or PTSD
often
fail to suppress intrusive thoughts
.
Enhancing this ���janitor��� function���via
brain stimulation or cognitive training
���might
restore mental flexibility
.
Researchers now plan to
stimulate the wave directly
(e.g., using TMS) to test if that improves forgetting and task performance.
����
AI and Everyday Life
In AI, forgetting is hard���algorithms struggle to ���know what not to remember.���
Future neural networks may incorporate
adaptive gain control
, mimicking human forgetting.
In real life, understanding how the brain forgets could improve
productivity, UX design
, and
mental health tech
.
������� Bottom Line
This research
redefines forgetting
as an
active, beneficial brain function
, not just a passive lapse. It gives neuroscientists a
concrete, measurable brainwave
���a ���neural broom������that may soon be harnessed for
treating mental illness
and
improving cognitive tools
, both biological and artificial.
