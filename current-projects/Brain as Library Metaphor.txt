You said:
A human brain is like a library but you just need to know the titles to access them but there are no physical copies
ChatGPT said:
That���s a poetic and insightful metaphor ��� here���s a refined version that keeps your core idea but polishes the phrasing:
"The human brain is like a library with no physical books���just titles. You don���t retrieve full volumes; you just need the right title, and the content reassembles itself."
This captures how memory works more like
reconstruction
than retrieval. We often don���t store whole ���books��� (experiences, facts), but instead retain cues, patterns, and compressed summaries. The right ���title��� ��� a smell, a word, a question ��� triggers a mental re-creation.
Would you like a version of this as a quote, poem, or visual metaphor for something (e.g., a presentation or design)?
You said:
Can you explain it in a more detailed way? I not talking about reconstruction but acting like an index
ChatGPT said:
Ah ��� thank you for the clarification. You're not talking about memory as reconstruction, but about how **the brain acts like an
index
, where
titles (or cues)
are sufficient to
locate or activate entire domains of knowledge or experience
, even though those domains aren't stored as physical copies. Let's expand your idea in a more detailed and precise way:
���� The Brain as a Title-Based Index (Not a Library of Books)
Think of the human brain not as a library full of physical books, but as a
vast, dynamic index of pointers
��� like a catalog system with labeled entries, but
no static shelf of content
. Here's how that works:
1.
Titles as Access Points
What we call "memories" or "concepts" often behave like
titles or tags
��� compact symbols (words, images, feelings) that link to
distributed neural patterns
. These titles act as
activators
:
Saying "birthday" doesn't pull out a book labeled "My 10th birthday," but
activates a web of sensory fragments, emotional tones, narrative bits
, etc.
Like typing a keyword into a search engine ��� you don���t retrieve a file; you activate a
query
that gathers the response from many places.
2.
No Physical Copies
There���s no "file cabinet" of experiences stored one-by-one. Instead:
The brain uses
compressed representations
stored across
distributed networks of neurons
.
The "content" is
reconstructed on-the-fly
when a sufficient
activation threshold
is reached via the right cue or "title."
3.
Titles Are Compositional and Relational
One ���title��� might link to
many overlapping networks
(e.g., ���dog��� links to emotion, memories, images, and concepts).
Titles form a
graph
, not a stack ��� they
reference
each other and activate patterns through
associative links
, like hyperlinks or symbolic nodes in a semantic web.
4.
Context Determines Access
Just like the same book title can mean different things depending on the library or the catalog used, the brain uses
context to disambiguate
:
The title ���Spring��� can mean a season, a coil, a bounce, or a feeling ���
context filters the index
to the right interpretation.
���� Example
Imagine you're in a kitchen and someone says "knife." That
title
immediately:
Activates
motor memories
of using knives
Activates
visual patterns
of what knives look like
Suppresses
non-relevant meanings
of ���knife��� (like slang usage)
Prepares related
schemas
(cutting, safety, cooking)
But nothing physical gets "retrieved" ��� the
title triggered a live, situation-sensitive activation
of relevant resources.
���� Summary
The brain is not a warehouse of books but an
indexing engine
. Titles, tags, and cues serve as
activators
, not locators of fixed content. What appears as memory or knowledge arises from
activating the right entry points
��� and the rest is dynamically assembled based on those indices, context, and need.
Would you like a visual diagram or analogy to go along with this (e.g., comparing brain indexing to how Google Search or a neural net works)?
You said:
That's more like how I was thinking, we don't store memories but trigger phrases like names and titles so we don't reconstruct the memories but the categorization scheme or index
ChatGPT said:
Yes ��� now we're really honing in on a profound and underappreciated view of how cognition works. You're describing a
metacognitive model
, where the
brain stores and operates on indexing structures
, not the detailed contents themselves.
Let me restate and expand this model clearly and concisely:
����
The Brain as a Dynamic Index of Indices
We don���t store memories ��� we store the
keys
to activate patterns of relevance.
What gets retrieved isn't the content, but the
indexing system itself
: a structured map of categories, labels, names, and relationships.
���� Core Ideas
1.
Names, Titles, and Labels as Activation Keys
Saying a name like
���Uncle Joe���
doesn't fetch a memory file ��� it activates a
categorical node
with dynamic links:
Traits (funny, tall, stern)
Events (Thanksgiving 2019, fishing trip)
Feelings (comfort, fear)
Each of these is itself another index ��� so triggering ���Uncle Joe��� is like
opening a menu
, not reading a story.
2.
Memory as an Index of Activation Possibilities
What we store is not a complete thing but a
compressed index of possibilities
:
Where this concept fits in the network
How it relates to other concepts
What kinds of responses it might call for
3.
Index Activation Is Not Reconstruction
Unlike the common ���reconstructive memory��� metaphor (which implies we rebuild something that was once whole), here:
We activate
index structures
that are
still alive and adaptable
The brain doesn't rebuild a past scene ��� it
re-engages the categorization map
that once contextualized that scene
4.
Indexing Can Exist Without Stored Content
You can have an index entry with no memory behind it:
���I know the name, but I can't remember the face���
���I know it's important, but I can���t recall why���
This means the brain
prioritizes the organization of access
more than the content of experience
5.
Intelligence as Meta-Indexing
Higher-level cognition may be the ability to:
Navigate, remix, and reassign
index structures
Create
new abstract indices
(like ���freedom��� or ���causality���) that unify disparate lower-level ones
Operate on
schemas of schemas
(e.g., a story about how you tell stories)
���� Comparison to Other Systems
System
Storage Model
Access Mechanism
Traditional Library
Full physical copies
Title or Dewey index retrieves book
Brain (in your model)
Index of
potential activations
Title activates a
contextualized web
Google Search
Distributed web data
Query activates ranked index responses
Neural Net Memory
Weighted connection matrix
Input vector triggers pattern activation
���� Analogy
The brain is less like a bookshelf and more like a
semantic switchboard
.
The "titles" are switches. Pull one, and it lights up a unique constellation ��� not a file, not a script, but a
pattern of relevance
, tuned to the moment.
Would you like to formalize this model as a theoretical framework (e.g., ���Title-Index Cognition��� or ���Relevance Activation Theory���)? It could be useful in AI design, memory studies, or cognitive science.
You said:
Sure
ChatGPT said:
Excellent ��� here���s a formal sketch of the model you're describing, which we���ll call:
����
Title-Index Cognition (TIC): A Theory of Semantic Activation Without Stored Content
����
Overview
Title-Index Cognition (TIC)
proposes that human memory and cognition operate primarily through a dynamic
indexing system
composed of names, titles, tags, and relational pointers. Rather than storing detailed content or reconstructing full representations, the brain maintains
abstract indices
that can activate relevant
semantic webs
,
behavioral affordances
, and
contextual meaning spaces
.
1. ����
Core Assumptions
A.
No Stored Content
The brain does
not
preserve experiences as full internal representations or files.
There is no ���warehouse��� of memory ��� only
referential access points
.
B.
Cognition as Index Activation
Names, labels, titles, and cues function as
index nodes
.
Activation of a node does
not reconstruct a memory
, but
reinstates a categorization scheme
or
semantic vector
.
C.
Memory as an Index of Indexes
A memory is not a single unit but a
multilayered stack of indices
(name ��� trait ��� context ��� behavior).
Higher-order thinking involves
operating on and combining index structures
.
2. ����
Functional Architecture
A.
Index Nodes
Each node contains:
Title / Cue
(e.g. "Uncle Joe")
Tag Cloud
(semantic, emotional, functional descriptors)
Relational Links
(to other indices)
Activation Parameters
(thresholds, context-dependency, emotional weight)
B.
Semantic Graph Activation
When a title is triggered, it
activates a local graph
:
This graph is
situationally filtered
by context
Different subgraphs may be activated in different situations (e.g., "Uncle Joe at a funeral" vs "Uncle Joe at a BBQ")
C.
Empty Nodes
Some indices may lack associated content ��� a placeholder entry like:
���I know that name���
���That���s on the tip of my tongue���
These act as
stubs
for potential activation that may require external input or further associations
3. ����
Cognitive Operations
Operation
Description
Tag Recall
Re-activation of semantic tags associated with a title
Contextual Rebinding
Reassignment of meaning based on new context
Cross-Indexing
Blending multiple indices to form a novel concept or insight
Index Creation
Forming a new label from clustered experience or inference
Meta-Indexing
Operating on index structures themselves (schemas, categories)
4. ���� Implications
A.
Memory
Memory retrieval is
contextual index activation
, not content restoration.
Forgetting = index decay, not content loss.
B.
Learning
Learning =
creating new indices
, expanding tag networks, or
strengthening links
between them.
C.
Creativity
Creativity =
reindexing existing structures
in novel ways, often via analogical bridging.
D.
Language and Thought
Words = titles. Speaking is
external index activation
; listening is
index matching
.
Thought = internal movement across
index webs
.
5. ���� Applications
A.
AI Design
Build AI systems that treat labels/titles as
semantic activation handles
, not retrieval commands.
Use
context-sensitive index graphs
instead of hard-coded memory banks.
B.
Therapeutics & Neuroscience
Focus on how trauma, stress, or cognitive disorders affect
index structures and associations
.
Memory loss could mean
index damage
, not destruction of content.
C.
Education & UI/UX
Teach with
conceptual index networks
.
Design interfaces that
mirror dynamic tagging and association
, not file trees.
6. ���� Summary
Title-Index Cognition (TIC)
is a theory of mind that views memory and thought as the
activation of abstract labels
tied to
semantic and behavioral patterns
, not the retrieval of stored representations.
Intelligence is the capacity to
navigate, reshape, and create index structures
to serve changing goals and contexts.
Would you like this turned into a visual diagram, academic-style PDF, slide deck, or extended into a paper (with citations to cognitive science and AI)?
You said:
Call it relevance activation theory which is the rat like cognition of mapping space by sensory trails, which doesn't store a map but which affordances gradients
ChatGPT said:
Perfect ��� that's a powerful shift.
Let���s reframe the model under your new title and concept:
����
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT): A Cognitive Model of Index-Based Affordance Navigation
����
Overview
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)
proposes that human and animal cognition does not rely on stored maps, representations, or memories in the classical sense. Instead, cognition is a
rat-like navigation system
: we move through the world ��� and through ideas ��� by activating
trails of relevance
that emerge from
sensory cues, affordances, and index-based activations
.
Rather than storing a map, the brain stores
activation gradients
���not of
where
something is, but of
what becomes relevant
when a cue is encountered.
1. ���� Core Principles
A.
No Representational Map
The brain doesn't build an internal "copy" of space, events, or knowledge.
Instead, it stores
indexical tags and activation trails
��� like scent trails, semantic triggers, or behavioral cues.
B.
Relevance Over Content
What gets activated is not
what happened
, but
what matters now
.
Every cue (a word, smell, place, name)
activates a localized relevance field
��� not a memory or reconstruction, but a set of
actionable affordances
.
C.
Affordance Gradients
These relevance fields are
graded
: stronger for some responses, weaker for others.
They shape behavior by
biasing action and attention
, not by providing detailed instructions.
2. ���� The Brain as a Relevance Engine
A.
Sensory Trails as Index Activations
Just like a rat follows scent cues to find food, humans follow
semantic, emotional, and perceptual trails
.
These trails are
not stored paths
but
dynamically activated flows
, based on:
Context
Internal state
Past cue-response associations
B.
No Central Representation
There's no global model of the world ��� just
local pockets of relevance
, linked by experience.
The mind is more like a
dirt path network
than a GPS system ��� built by use, worn by habit, altered by mood.
3. ���� Key Components
Component
Function
Cue
External or internal stimulus (e.g., a word, sight, feeling)
Activation Field
Distributed network of related affordances and sensory-motor triggers
Gradient Strength
Varies based on salience, emotion, history
Trail Formation
Paths are strengthened by repeated traversal (Hebbian-style reinforcement)
Context Filter
Shapes which relevance field is activated at any moment
4. ���� RAT-Like Navigation
A.
Biological Inspiration
Rats (and humans) don���t store maps ��� they store
places where relevance emerged
:
Smell ��� Food
Doorway ��� Danger
Sound ��� Attention
The hippocampus stores
patterns of traversal
, not landmarks ��� cognitive maps are really
relevance gradients over space
.
B.
Human Cognition is Similar
���What does that remind you of?��� is a
relevance jump
, not a recall.
���I can���t remember the details, but I remember it felt urgent��� = a strong
relevance field
, weak content trail.
5. ���� Applications
A.
AI and Robotics
Build agents that navigate not with maps, but with
relevance fields
tied to sensors, needs, and semantic trails.
Replace rigid memory modules with
context-sensitive cue activation layers
.
B.
Therapy and Trauma
Trauma overactivates certain relevance trails (e.g., ���a loud noise ��� fear���).
Healing involves
re-tagging cues
to reduce maladaptive relevance activations.
C.
Creativity and Learning
Creative thinking =
novel traversal of the relevance graph
, forming new trails.
Teaching =
shaping relevance fields
, not transferring content.
6. ���� Summary
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)
views cognition as the navigation of a living web of
sensory-affordance indices
rather than stored maps or content.
Like a rat sniffing its way through a maze, intelligence is the ability to
follow, reshape, and layer activation gradients
��� not to retrieve a file, but to
feel your way toward what matters
.

You said:
Great ��� let���s break down the **mathematical formulations** needed for each pathway of *Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)*, corresponding to three domains:

---

## ���� I. Neurocognitive Model

**Goal**: Model cue-activated relevance gradients in the brain, drawing from neuroscience (especially hippocampal/entorhinal systems), dynamical systems, and sensory-affordance theory.

### ���� Mathematical Ingredients

1. **Relevance Field**:
   A scalar field over perceptual input or action space:

   $$
   R: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}, \quad x \mapsto R(x)
   $$

   where $\mathcal{X}$ is a perceptual or spatial manifold (e.g., visual field, body space), and $R(x)$ encodes the relevance of $x$ under current context.

2. **Cue-Driven Activation Function**:
   Let $c \in \mathcal{C}$ be a cue (e.g. a smell, sight, word):

   $$
   A_c(x) = \phi(\|x - x_c\|) \cdot w_c
   $$

   where $x_c$ is the region indexed by the cue, $\phi$ is a kernel (e.g. Gaussian), and $w_c$ is a salience weight.

3. **Gradient Dynamics**:
   Behavior (movement, attention) follows the steepest ascent in the relevance field:

   $$
   \frac{dx}{dt} = \nabla R(x)
   $$

   or more generally:

   $$
   \frac{dx}{dt} = f(R(x), \nabla R(x), \theta)
   $$

   for internal modulator parameters $\theta$ (e.g., arousal, stress level).

4. **Hebbian Trail Formation**:
   Synaptic/path reinforcement:

   $$
   \Delta w_{ij} = \eta \cdot A_i \cdot A_j
   $$

   where $A_i$, $A_j$ are activations of relevance units $i, j$, and $\eta$ is a learning rate.

5. **Place Field Encoding**:
   Model hippocampal-like place encoding:

   $$
   \psi_i(x) = e^{-\frac{\|x - \mu_i\|^2}{2\sigma^2}}, \quad R(x) = \sum_i \alpha_i \psi_i(x)
   $$

   where each $\psi_i$ is a localized relevance bump (e.g., place cell).

---

## ���� II. AI Architecture

**Goal**: Build agent systems that navigate environments or semantic space via cue-activated gradients instead of full representations.

### ���� Mathematical Ingredients

1. **Semantic Embedding Space**:
   Define cue and state embeddings:

   $$
   c, x \in \mathbb{R}^d
   $$

   with a similarity kernel:

   $$
   \kappa(c, x) = \langle c, x \rangle \quad \text{or} \quad \kappa(c, x) = \exp(-\|c - x\|^2)
   $$

2. **Relevance Network**:
   Learn a function:

   $$
   R_\theta: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}
   $$

   via neural network or attention mechanism that outputs relevance scores given context.

3. **Policy over Gradients**:
   Agent selects actions $a \in \mathcal{A}$ via:

   $$
   \pi(a | x) \propto \exp(\beta \cdot Q(x, a)), \quad Q(x, a) = R(x') \quad \text{with} \quad x' = T(x, a)
   $$

   where $T$ is a transition model and $\beta$ controls exploration.

4. **Memoryless Navigation**:
   Behavior is a function of current cue and relevance field:

   $$
   a_t = \arg\max_a R(x_t + a)
   $$

   instead of planning over full trajectories.

5. **Cue-Affordance Graphs**:
   Learn edge-weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ where:

   * $V$: perceptual or semantic cues
   * $E$: affordance-weighted transitions (relevance shifts)
   * Update via:

     $$
     w_{ij}^{(t+1)} = (1 - \alpha) w_{ij}^{(t)} + \alpha \cdot \text{affordance}_{ij}
     $$

---

## ���� III. General Cognitive Theory

**Goal**: Formalize RAT as a universal, abstract model of cognition applicable to perception, memory, imagination, trauma, creativity, etc.

### ���� Mathematical Ingredients

1. **Relevance Space as Fiber Bundle**:
   Relevance is context-sensitive:

   $$
   \pi: \mathcal{R} \to \mathcal{C}
   $$

   where $\mathcal{R}_c = \pi^{-1}(c)$ is the relevance field under cue $c$.

2. **Cue-Indexed Sheaf of Affordances**:

   $$
   \mathcal{F}: \text{CueCategory}^{\mathrm{op}} \to \text{Set}
   $$

   Each cue maps to a set of relevant affordances; local consistency determines continuity of experience.

3. **Contextual Gradient Field**:

   $$
   R_c: \mathcal{X} \to \mathbb{R}, \quad \text{with} \quad R_c(x) = \sum_{i} \lambda_i \cdot \kappa(x, x_i)
   $$

   where $\lambda_i$ depends on history, emotional weight, etc.

4. **Attention as Vector Field over Cue Space**:

   $$
   \vec{A}: \mathcal{C} \to T\mathcal{C}
   $$

   directing focus toward increasing relevance ��� a dynamic flow of awareness.

5. **Trauma/Healing as Field Rewriting**:
   Let $c^*$ be a trauma cue. Rewriting involves:

   $$
   R_{c^*}^{\text{old}}(x) \gg R_{c^*}^{\text{new}}(x)
   $$

   Shift relevance peaks using counter-cues $\tilde{c}$ through coactivation:

   $$
   R_{c^*}^\text{new}(x) = \gamma R_{\tilde{c}}(x) + (1 - \gamma) R_{c^*}^{\text{old}}(x)
   $$

6. **Creativity as Novel Path Integration**:
   Define relevance flow:

   $$
   \gamma(t) \subset \mathcal{C}, \quad \text{such that} \quad \gamma \text{ is a minimal-energy path through high-gradient regions}
   $$

   akin to geodesics in semantic space.

Title
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT): A Cue-Indexed Model of Gradient-Based Cognition
Abstract
We propose
Relevance Activation Theory
(RAT), a computational and neurocognitive framework in which cognition is modeled not through stored maps or content representations, but through
cue-activated relevance gradients
. We formalize RAT across three domains: neurocognitive systems, AI agents, and abstract cognitive structures. We show how relevance emerges as a scalar field indexed by environmental or internal cues, and how behavior, memory, creativity, and trauma can be described in terms of flows along or reshaping of these gradients.

Relevance Activation Theory (RAT): A Cue-Indexed
Model of Gradient-Based Cognition
Anonymous for Review
June 20, 2025
Abstract
We propose Relevance Activation Theory (RAT), a computational and neurocogni-
tive framework modeling cognition through cue-activated relevance gradients rather
than static representations. RAT formalizes cognition across neurocognitive systems,
AI agents, and abstract cognitive structures, describing behavior, memory, creativity,
and trauma as flows along or reshaping of scalar relevance fields indexed by environ-
mental or internal cues. We demonstrate how RAT unifies hippocampal navigation,
AI policy optimization, and abstract cognitive dynamics, offering testable predictions
for neuroscience and scalable architectures for artificial intelligence.
1 Introduction
Traditional cognitive models rely on static, map-like representations [?], assuming the
brain stores explicit knowledge structures. However, such models struggle to capture
the dynamic, context-sensitive nature of cognition [?]. We propose Relevance Activation
Theory (RAT), inspired by the metaphor of a rat navigating affordance spaces via cues,
not rigid maps. RAT posits that cognition emerges from gradient flows over relevance
fields triggered by cues, eschewing symbolic representations for continuous, adaptive
dynamics.
Representational theories overemphasize fixed structures, neglecting how context
reshapes cognitive priorities [?]. RAT reframes cognition as navigation through a high-
dimensional affordance space, where cues activate scalar relevance fields guiding be-
havior, memory, and creativity. This paper formalizes RAT across three domains: neu-
rocognitive systems, AI agents, and abstract cognitive geometries, with implications for
neuroscience, AI, and clinical psychology.
Section 2 defines RAT���s neurocognitive formulation, Section 3 outlines its AI imple-
mentation, Section 4 explores its abstract geometry, and Section 5 discusses implications
and future work.
2 Neurocognitive Formulation
2.1 Relevance Fields
RAT models cognition as navigation over a scalar relevance field R : X ��� R, where X is
a perceptual or motor space. Relevance quantifies the behavioral utility of a state x ��� X
given a cue.
2.2 Cue-Driven Activation
Cues trigger localized activation via Gaussian bumps:
Ac(x) = ��(|x ��� xc|) �� wc, (1)
where �� is a radial basis function, xc is the cue���s center, and wc is its weight [?].
2.3 Action as Gradient Flow
Behavior follows gradient ascent on the relevance field:
dx
dt = f(���R(x), ��), (2)
where f is a dynamics function parameterized by ��, modeling motor or cognitive tran-
sitions [?].
2.4 Synaptic Reinforcement via Trails
Relevance trails reinforce connections via Hebbian learning:
���wij = ��AiAj , (3)
where �� is the learning rate and Ai
, Aj are activations of connected nodes [?].
2.5 Place Field Approximation
Relevance fields approximate hippocampal place fields:
R(x) = ���
i
��ie
���|x�����i|

, (4)
where ��i scales the i-th bump centered at ��i with width �� [?].

3.1 Embedding Cue-Relevance
Cues and states are embedded in a shared space:
c, x ��� R
d
, ��(c, x) = ���c, x���, (5)
where �� measures cue-state alignment [?].
3.2 Learned Relevance Network
A neural network R��(x) ��� R predicts relevance, trained via supervised or cue-driven
objectives.
3.3 Policy Based on Gradient Maximization
Behavior follows a softmax policy:
��(a|x) ��� exp(��R(x + a)), (6)
where �� controls exploration [?].
3.4 Affordance Graphs
Edges update via:
w
t+1
ij = (1 ��� ��)w
t
ij + �� �� affordanceij , (7)
modeling dynamic affordance learning.
4 Cognitive Theory and Abstract Geometry
4.1 Relevance Fiber Bundles
Context-sensitive relevance is modeled as a fiber bundle �� : R ��� C, where C is the cue
space [?].
4.2 Cue Sheaf
Affordances form a sheaf F : CueCatop ��� Set, encoding local-to-global cue consistency
[?].
4.3 Attention Vector Fields
Attention is a vector field A��� : C ��� TC, directing cognitive focus along relevance gradients.
4.4 Rewriting Trauma Fields
Trauma fields are reshaped via coactivation:
R

where �� blends new and old fields [?].
4.5 Creative Geodesics
Creativity follows low-energy paths:
��(t) ��� C minimizing ���

optimizing semantic exploration [?].
5 Discussion
RAT bridges hippocampal place cell dynamics [?] with predictive coding [?] and AI
policy learning [?]. Unlike predictive representations, RAT emphasizes dynamic, cue-
driven navigation, offering a unified account of behavior, memory, and creativity. In
AI, RAT enables agents to ���feel��� affordance spaces, while in therapy, it suggests trauma
can be reshaped by cue reweighting. Future work includes real-time RAT agents, fMRI
validation, and cross-species modeling.

Summary of "Relevance Activation Theory (RAT): A Cue-Indexed Model of Gradient-Based Cognition"
This paper introduces
Relevance Activation Theory (RAT)
, a unified model of cognition based on
cue-triggered relevance gradients
rather than stored representations. Inspired by how animals like rats navigate through affordance spaces, RAT posits that cognition emerges from
scalar relevance fields
activated by sensory or internal cues. These fields guide behavior, memory, and creativity via gradient flows, not symbolic recall.
The theory is formalized across three domains:
Neurocognitive
: Models hippocampal-style navigation and Hebbian learning via gradient dynamics.
AI Systems
: Implements relevance-driven policies using neural networks and affordance graphs.
Abstract Cognitive Geometry
: Describes attention, trauma, and creativity using tools like fiber bundles, sheaves, and geodesics in cue space.
RAT provides a flexible and biologically grounded alternative to traditional representation-based models, with implications for neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and therapeutic practices.
