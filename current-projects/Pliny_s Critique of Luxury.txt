It now remains for us to speak of stones, or, in other words, the leading folly of the day; to say nothing at all of our taste for gems and amber, crystal and murrhine vases.

For everything of which we have previously treated, down to the present Book, may, by some possibility or other, have the appearance of having been created for the sake of man: but as to the mountains, 

Nature has made those for herself, as a kind of bulwark for keeping together the bowels of the earth; as also for the purpose of curbing the violence of the rivers, of breaking the waves of the sea, and so, by opposing to them the very hardest of her materials, putting a check upon those elements which are never at rest.

And yet we must hew down these mountains, forsooth, and carry them off; and this, for no other reason than to gratify our luxurious inclinations: heights which in former days it was reckoned a miracle even to have crossed!

Our forefathers regarded as a prodigy the passage of the Alps, first by Hannibal, and, more recently, by the Cimbri: but at the present day, these very mountains are cut asunder to yield us a thousand different marbles, promontories are thrown open to the sea, and the face of Nature is being everywhere reduced to a level.

We now carry away the barriers that were destined for the separation of one nation from another; we construct ships for the transport of our marbles; and, amid the waves, the most boisterous element of Nature, we convey the summits of the mountains to and fro: a thing, however, that is even less unpardonable than to go on the search amid the regions of the clouds for vessels with which to cool our draughts, and to excavate rocks, towering to the very heavens, in order that we may have the satisfaction of drinking from ice!

Let each reflect, when he hears of the high prices set upon these things, when he sees these ponderous masses carted and carried away, how many there are whose life is passed far more happily without them.

For what utility or for what so-called pleasure do mortals make themselves the agents, or, more truly speaking, the victims of such undertakings, except in order that others may take their repose in the midst of variegated stones?

Just as though too, the shades of night, which occupy one half of each man's existence, would forbear to curtail these imaginary delights.

This remarkable passage is from
Pliny the Elder
, in
Natural History
(Book XXXVI), and it reads like a sharply pointed critique of human vanity and the ecological cost of luxury.
Here���s a distilled summary of the themes and arguments, framed with a modern interpretive lens:
����
Nature vs. Luxury: A Misuse of Creation
Pliny distinguishes between what Nature seems to have made
for us
���animals, plants, metals���and what she made
for herself
: the
mountains
, described not as aesthetic features but
structural supports
holding the earth together and controlling rivers and seas.
"Nature has made those for herself... as a bulwark... to curb the violence of the rivers... to put a check upon those elements which are never at rest."
����
Mountains as Sacred Boundaries
Mountains once evoked awe and fear. Their traversal���such as Hannibal crossing the Alps���was seen as miraculous. Yet in Pliny���s time, mountains are
exploited
, cut down, shipped across oceans, and reduced to mere
ornamentation
.
"We now carry away the barriers that were destined for the separation of one nation from another..."
����
Folly of Human Desire
He rebukes the decadence of his age: excavating sky-high rocks
just to chill a drink
in a murrhine or crystal cup. What was once unthinkable (transporting mountain peaks across the sea) has become commonplace���all
to furnish rooms with polished stones
.
"...the satisfaction of drinking from ice!"
����
Suffering and Inequity
Pliny urges the reader to consider how many live happily without such extravagances, and how the luxury of a few depends on the
toil and sacrifice of many
���calling those who undertake these projects
victims
, not beneficiaries.
"For what utility or for what so-called pleasure... except in order that others may take their repose in the midst of variegated stones?"
����
The Irony of Darkness
A final, poetic blow: half of human life is spent in
darkness
, rendering all that glittering marble useless.
"Just as though... the shades of night... would forbear to curtail these imaginary delights."
������ Modern Relevance
Pliny���s voice resonates strongly today as a
proto-environmentalist
, critiquing:
Extractive luxury
The destruction of natural barriers
Vanity-driven environmental ruin
The inequality built into aesthetic excess
He exposes how
technological power
and
economic ambition
can blind societies to what is necessary, sacred, and shared.
